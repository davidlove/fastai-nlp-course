"Saint-Just made it clear that the reach of virtuous terror would be very wide: ""There is no prosperity to hope for as long as the last enemy of liberty breathes. You have to punish not only the traitors, but even those who are indifferent; you have to punish whoever is passive in the republic, and who does nothing for it."" And, chillingly: ""What constitutes a republic is the total destruction of everything that stands opposed to it.""",The Guillotine Mystique,reason.com,,,,,order,2,2020-11-26 03:28:15+00:00
"Robespierre's grand vision was laid out in a February 1794 speech to the Convention titled ""The Principles of Political Morality."" The goal of the Republic, he declared, was to fulfill the true human potential that tyranny had warped: Selfishness, frivolity, greed, sensuality, vanity, and social graces would give way to magnanimity, wisdom, reason, and love of goodness, truth, and glory, ushering in ""the dawn of the bright day of universal happiness."" Until then, ""the despotism of liberty against tyranny"" would have to do: ""If the spring of popular government in time of peace is virtue, the springs of popular government in revolution are at once virtue and terror. Virtue without terror is fatal; terror without virtue is powerless. Terror is nothing other than justice: prompt, severe, inflexible. It is therefore an emanation of virtue."" Talk of mercy, Robespierre stressed, was dangerously misguided: ""To punish the oppressors of humanity is clemency; to forgive them is cruelty.""",The Guillotine Mystique,reason.com,,,,,order,1,2020-11-26 03:28:09+00:00

Part of this is the pleasure of not having to expend energy maintaining temperature homeostasis. The pleasure of privacy is similar: freedom from having to expend cognitive energy in modeling others and conforming one’s behavior to the standards of public self-presentation, in order to maintain status homeostasis.

Communication is especially important when things go wrong. It is relatively easy to design things that work smoothly and harmoniously as long as things go right.

"An American white ambassador in one African country was Africa’s most respected Americanican ambassador: I’m glad to say that this was told to me by one ranking African leader. We talked for an entire afternoon. Based on what I had heard of him, I had to believe him when he told me that as long as he was on the African continent, he never thought in terms of race, that he dealt with human beings, never noticing their color. He said he was more aware of language differences than of color differences. He said that only when he returned to America would he become aware of color differences. 

I told him, “What you are telling me is that it isn’t the American white man who is a racist, but it’s the American political, economic, and social atmosphere that automatically nourishes a racist psychology in the white man.” He agreed. 

We both agreed that American society makes it next to impossible for humans to meet in America and not be conscious of their color differences. And we both agreed that if racism could be removed, America could offer a society where rich and poor could truly live like human beings. 

That discussion with the ambassador gave me a new insight—one which I like: that the white man is not inherently evil, but America’s racist society influences him to act evilly.

"Nothing in either of my two careers as a black man in America had served to give me any idealistic tendencies. My instincts automatically examined the reasons, the motives, of anyone who did anything they didn’t have to do for me. Always in my life, if it was any white person, I could see a selfish motive. 

But there in that hotel that morning, a telephone call and a few hours away from the cot on the fourth-floor tier of the dormitory, was one of the few times I had been so awed that I was totally without resistance. That white man—at least he would have been considered “white” in America—related to Arabia’s ruler, to whom he was a close advisor, truly an international man, with nothing in the world to gain, had given up his suite to me, for my transient comfort. He had nothing to gain. He didn’t need me. He had everything. In fact, he had more to lose than gain. He had followed the American press about me. If he did that, he knew there was only stigma attached to me. I was supposed to have horns. I was a “racist.” I was “anti-white”—and he from all appearances was white. I was supposed to be a criminal; not only that, but everyone was even accusing me of using his religion of Islam as a cloak for my criminal practices and philosophies. Even if he had had some motive to use me, he knew that I was separated from Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam, my “power base,” according to the press in America. The only organization that I had was just a few weeks old. I had no job. I had no money. Just to get over there, I had had to borrow money from my sister.",The Autobiography of Malcolm X,Malcolm X,,On Muslim hospitality that he received after making a call when stuck traveling to Mecca,,,order,2,2020-11-08 13:35:40.175275+00:00
"And because I had been a hustler, I knew better than all whites knew, and better than nearly all of the black “leaders” knew, that actually the most dangerous black man in America was the ghetto hustler. 

Why do I say this? The hustler, out there in the ghetto jungles, has less respect for the white power structure than any other Negro in North America. The ghetto hustler is internally restrained by nothing. He has no religion, no concept of morality, no civic responsibility, no fear—nothing. To survive, he is out there constantly preying upon others, probing for any human weakness like a ferret. The ghetto hustler is forever frustrated, restless, and anxious for some “action.” Whatever he undertakes, he commits himself to it fully, absolutely. 

What makes the ghetto hustler yet more dangerous is his “glamor” image to the school-dropout youth in the ghetto. These ghetto teen-agers see the hell caught by their parents struggling to get somewhere, or see that they have given up struggling in the prejudiced, intolerant white man’s world. The ghetto teen-agers make up their own minds they would rather be like the hustlers whom they see dressed “sharp” and flashing money and displaying no respect for anybody or anything. So the ghetto youth become attracted to the hustler worlds of dope, thievery, prostitution, and general crime and immorality.",The Autobiography of Malcolm X,Malcolm X,,,,,order,5,2020-11-08 13:35:39.179997+00:00
"“During the past eleven days here in the Muslim world, I have eaten from the same plate, drunk from the same glass, and slept in the same bed (or on the same rug)—while praying to the same God—with fellow Muslims, whose eyes were the bluest of blue, whose hair was the blondest of blond, and whose skin was the whitest of white. And in the words and in the actions and in the deeds of the ‘white’ Muslims, I felt the same sincerity that I felt among the black African Muslims of Nigeria, Sudan, and Ghana. 

“We were truly all the same (brothers)—because their belief in one God had removed the ‘white’ from their minds, the ‘white’ from their behavior, and the ‘white’ from their attitude.

"That morning was when I first began to reappraise the “white man.” It was when I first began to perceive that “white man,” as commonly used, means complexion only secondarily; primarily it described attitudes and actions. In America, “white man” meant specific attitudes and actions toward the black man, and toward all other non-white men. But in the Muslim world, I had seen that men with white complexions were more genuinely brotherly than anyone else had ever been.

Anyway, he swore that if a woman, any woman, gets really carried away while dancing, what she truly is—at least potentially—will surface and show on her face. 

I’m not suggesting that a lady-of-easy-virtue look danced to the surface in Laura—although life did deal her cruel blows, starting with her meeting me.

The truth is that “integration” is an image, it’s a foxy Northern liberal’s smokescreen that confuses the true wants of the American black man. Here in these fifty racist and neo-racist states of North America, this word “integration” has millions of white people confused, and angry, believing wrongly that the black masses want to live mixed up with the white man. That is the case only with the relative handful of these “integration”-mad Negroes. ... Human rights! Respect as human beings! That’s what America’s black masses want. That’s the true problem.

After all, this is a company that has developed two major products: a really good search engine and a pretty good Hotmail clone. Every other major success it’s had — Android, YouTube, Google Maps, etc. — has come through an acquisition of a nascent competitor. Many of the company’s key divisions, such as the advertising technology of DoubleClick, violate the historical antitrust principle of structural separation, which forbade firms from owning subsidiaries that competed with their customers. Railroads, for example, were barred from owning freight companies that competed with the shippers whose freight they carried. 
If we’re worried about giant companies subverting markets by stripping consumers of their ability to make free choices, then vigorous antitrust enforcement seems like an excellent remedy. If we’d denied Google the right to effect its many mergers, we would also have probably denied it its total search dominance.

"The conclusions we have drawn as a result of our analysis of socialism are also confirmed, as we see, by a series of independent arguments. We may formulate these conclusions as follows:

a. The idea of the death of mankind--not the death of specific people but literally the end of the human race--evokes a response in the human psyche. It arouses and attracts people, albeit with differing intensity in different epochs and in different individuals. The scope of influence of this idea causes us to suppose that every individual is affected by it to a greater or lesser degree and that it is a universal trait of the human psyche.

b. This idea is not only manifested in the individual experience of a great number of specific persons, but is also capable of uniting people (in contrast to delirium, for example) i.e., it is a social force.

"The differences between them (which explain, incidentally, why Bakunin has far less influence than Marx and Engels on history) lie not in the fact that Marxism renounced elements of nihilism but that it added to them some new and very significant elements. Marxism is based on the same psychological foundation as nihilism--a burning hatred for surrounding life that can be vented only through complete annihilation of that life. But Marxism finds a means of transferring this purely subjective perception of the world onto another, more objective plane. As with art, where passion is kept in check and transformed into creative works, Marxism accomplished a transformation of the elemental, destructive emotions that ruled Bakunin and Nechayev into a structure that seemed incomparably more objective and hence convincing--the concept of man's subordination to ""immanent laws"" or ""the dialectics of production.""",The Socialist Phenomenon by Igor Shafarevich,Igor Shafarevich,,,,,order,96,2018-08-18 01:24:54+00:00
"We can see that all elements of the socialist ideal--the abolition of private property, family, hierarchies; the hostility toward religion--could be regarded as a manifestation of one basic principle: the suppression of individuality. It is possible to demonstrate this graphically by listing the more typical features that keep appearing in socialist theory and practice over two and a half thousand years, from Plato to Berlin's ""Commune No.1,"" and then constructing a model of an ""ideal"" (albeit nonexistent) socialist society. People would wear the same clothing and even have similar faces; they would live in barracks. There would be compulsory labor followed by meals and leisure activities in the company of the same labor battalion. Passes would be required for going outside. Doctors and officials would supervise sexual relations, which would be subordinated to only two goals: the satisfaction of physiological needs and the production of healthy offspring. Children would be brought up from infancy in state nurseries and schools. Philosophy and art would be completely politicized and subordinated to the educational goals of the state. All this is inspired by one principle--the destruction of individuality or, at least, its suppression to the point where it would cease to be a social force.

(3: V: pp. 506-507) Marx says: ""The essence of man is not an abstract quality inherent in a separate individual. In reality it is the aggregate of all social relations."" (3: IV: p. 590) Marx was concerned with the question of why, under conditions of complete political emancipation, religion does not disappear. From his point of view, this testifies to the fact that a certain flaw remains in society, but the reason for this flaw should be sought in the very essence of the state. Religion is no longer presented as a cause but as a manifestation of general narrowmindedness. The essence of this narrow-mindedness and limitation he sees in the following: ""Political democracy is Christian in nature because man in it--not man in general but each man separately--is considered a sovereign and supreme being",The Socialist Phenomenon by Igor Shafarevich,Igor Shafarevich,,,,,order,93,2018-08-18 00:37:28+00:00

"Finally, here is how Piatakov, already expelled from the party and in disgrace, described his view of the party to his former party comrade Valentinov. Piatakov reminded him of Lenin's statement that the ""dictatorship of the proletariat is a regime implemented by the party, which relies on violence and is not bound by any law."" (From the article ""The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky."") Piatakov explained that the central idea here was not ""violence"" but the fact of being ""unbound by any law."" He says:

Everything that bears the imprint of human will must not and cannot be considered inviolable or tied to any insuperable law. A law is a limit, a ban, a definition of one phenomenon admissible and another inadmissible, one action possible and the other impossible. When thought holds to violence in principle and is psychologically free, unbound by any laws, limits or obstacles, then the field of possible action expands to gigantic proportions and the field of the impossible contracts to the point of zero.. ..Bolshevism is a party whose idea is to bring into life that which is considered impossible, not realizable and inadmissible. ...For the honor and happiness of being in its ranks we must sacrifice our pride and self-esteem and everything

[217]
else. Returning to the party, we put out of our heads all convictions condemned by it, even though we defended them while in opposition. ...I agree that non-Bolsheviks and the category of ordinary people in general cannot make any instantaneous change, any reversal or amputation of their convictions. ...Weare a party of men who make the impossible possible. Steeped in the idea of violence, we direct it against ourselves, and if the party demands it and if it is necessary and important for the party, we can by an act of will put out of our heads in twenty-four hours ideas that we have cherished for years. In suppressing one's convictions or tossing them aside, it is necessary to reorient oneself in the shortest possible time in such a way as to agree, inwardly, with one's whole mind. ...Is it easy to put out of mind things that only yesterday you considered to be right and which today you must consider to be false in order to be in full accord with the party? Of course not. Nevertheless, through violence directed against oneself, the necessary result is achieved. Giving up life, shooting oneself through the head, are mere trifles compared with this other manifestation of will. ...This sort of violence against the self is acutely painful, but such violence with the aim of breaking oneself so as to be in full accord with the party constitutes the essence of a truly principled Bolshevik Communist. I am familiar with objections of the following kind. The party may be absolutely mistaken, it is said, it might call black something that is clearly and indisputably white. To all those who try to foist this example on me, I say: Yes, I shall consider black something that I felt and considered to be white, since outside the party, outside accord with it, there is no life for me.

"But with almost perverse consistency, most of the projections of Marxism have proved to be incorrect. A better percentage of correct predictions could probably have been achieved by making random guesses. Examples have been cited repeatedly, and for this reason we limit ourselves to three in order to underscore the typical and in most cases fundamental nature of the errors: the truth proved to be not merely different but in fact the opposite to that which had been predicted.

a. The national question: ""National differences and antagonistic interests among various peoples are already vanishing more and more thanks to the development of the bourgeoisie, to freedom of commerce, to the world market, to uniformity in the mode of production and in the corresponding conditions of life. The supremacy of the proletariat will accelerate the disappearance of differences."" (3: V: p. 500)

b. In particular, the Jewish question, which was to disappear as soon as financial operations and petty trade became impossible. ""The chimerical nationality of the Jew is the nationality of a merchant, in general of a man who deals with money."" (3: I: p. 382) ""An organization of society which could remove the preconditions of petty trade, and therefore the possibility of petty trade, would make Jewry impossible."" (3: I: p. 379)

c. The role of the state: ""The first act in which the state truly comes forward as a representative of the whole of society--the taking possession of the means of production in the name of society--is, at the same time, its last independent act as a state. Interference of the state in social relations becomes superfluous in one sphere after another, and then ceases of itself. The government of persons is replaced by the administration of things and the direction of the process of production. The state is not 'abolished'; it withers away."" (98: p. 285)

""With the disappearance of classes the state inevitably disappears. A society which organizes its production in a new fashion based on 

[206]
the free and equal association of producers will send the machine of the state to the place where it will then belong: the museum of antiquity, next to the spinning wheel and the bronze ax.""

In other doctrines, as well as in certain socialist states, this proposition is not proclaimed in such radical form, but the principle appears as a de-emphasis of the role of the family, the weakening of family ties, the abolition of certain functions of the family. Again, the negative form of the principle is more common. As a positive statement about specific relationships between the sexes or between parents and children, it appears in several variants as the total obliteration of the family, communality of wives and the destruction of all ties between parent and child to the point where they may not even know each other; as an impairment and a weakening of family ties; or as the transformation of the family into a unit of the bureaucratic state subjected to its goals and control.",The Socialist Phenomenon by Igor Shafarevich,Igor Shafarevich,,,,,order,72,2018-08-16 11:26:34+00:00
"To what extent is it possible to call the Inca state socialist? Without any doubt, it is much more entitled to this designation than any of the contemporary states that regard themselves as belonging to this category. Socialist principles were clearly expressed in the structure of the Inca state: the almost complete absence of private property, in particular of private land; absence of money and trade; the complete elimination of private initiative from all economic activities; detailed regulation of private life; marriage by official decree; state distribution of wives and concubines. On the other hand, we do not encounter 

[141]
either communal wives or communal upbringing of children. A wife, though given by the state to the peasant, was his alone, and children grew up in the family (if the special class of girls chosen to be ""elect"" is excluded). Nevertheless, the Inca state seems to have been one of the fullest incarnations of socialist ideals in human history.
This is indicated by the striking similarity between the Inca way of life and numerous socialist utopias, sometimes down to the smallest detail. In his work The Incas of Peru, Baudin tells that during a report on the Inca state at the Paris Academy of Sciences, a member asked whether it would not be possible to show an influence of the Incas on Thomas More's Utopia. (56: p. 165) This would have been quite impossible, of course: More's Utopia was written in 1516, while Peru was discovered by the Spaniards in 1531. The similarities are, therefore, all the more striking and show how socialist principles inevitably led to the same conclusions in the centuries-long practice of the Inca administrators and in the mind of the English philosopher.",The Socialist Phenomenon by Igor Shafarevich,Igor Shafarevich,,,,,order,68,2018-08-15 12:39:37+00:00
"The complete subjugation of life to the prescriptions of the law

Repetition of the same descriptive details is characteristic of the old Spanish accounts. The capital city, built of identical houses made of identical block stone and divided into identical blocks, undoubtedly created the impression of a prison town. (56: p. 117)
As a result of this spirit of standardization, anything the least bit different was looked upon as dangerous and hostile, whether it was the birth of twins or the discovery of a strangely shaped rock. Such things were believed to be a manifestation of evil forces hostile to society. Events were to show that the fear of unplanned phenomena was quite justified: the huge empire proved powerless against less than two hundred Spaniards. Neither their firearms nor their horses (animals unknown to the Indians) can explain this extraordinary turn of events. The same difference in armaments was after all involved in the subjugation of the Zulus, but they were able to mount a long and successful resistance to large detachments of English forces. The reason for the collapse of the Inca empire must apparently be sought elsewhere--in the complete atrophy of individual initiative, in the ingrained habit of acting only at the direction of officials, in the spirit of stagnation and apathy.",The Socialist Phenomenon by Igor Shafarevich,Igor Shafarevich,,,,,order,67,2018-08-15 12:37:53+00:00
"The laws regulating life in the Inca state relied on a sophisticated system of punishment. Penalties were severe--almost always death or torture.

Thus a man guilty of cutting down a tree or stealing fruit in a state plantation was subject to the death penalty. Abortion was punished by death for the woman and for anyone who may have assisted her.

In the world view of the participants in the ""Conspiracy of Equals,"" we can see this conception in finished form.

b. A castigation of the way things are. Contemporary society is pronounced incurably depraved, unjust and meaningless, ready only to be scrapped. Only on its ruins can a new social structure be built, a structure that would guarantee people every happiness of which they are capable.

The external, exoteric circle of participants in the sect was made up from these social elements, while the Free Spirits, those who had attained ""Godliness,"" formed a narrow, esoteric circle. The division into two categories recalls the Cathars with their chosen circle of the perfecti.

The broad masses that formed the exoteric circle of the sect were poorly informed about the radical nature of the doctrine, as numerous surviving records of the proceedings of the Inquisition make clear. The ordinary followers felt that the divinity of the Free Spirits justified their right to be spiritual guides. For this group, the most significant aspects of the doctrine were those that proclaimed the idea of communality in its most extreme form and rejected the fundamental institutions of society: private property, the family, the church and the state. It is here that we can see the sect's socialist aspects. The assertion that ""all property ought to be held in common"" is cited frequently as one of the elements of the doctrine (e.g., 15: p. 53).

"Joachim was a monk and an abbot. His doctrine, as he claimed, was based partly on the study of the Holy Scriptures and partly on revelation.

Joachim divided history into three epochs: the Kingdom of the Father, from Adam to Christ; the Kingdom of the Son, from Christ until 1260; and the Kingdom of the Spirit, which was to begin in 1260. The first was an age of slavish submission; the second, an age of filial obedience; while the third was to be an age of freedom. For in the words of the Apostle: ""Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."" In this last epoch, God's people would abide in peace, freed from labor and suffering. This would be an age of the humble and the poor; people would not know the words ""thine"" and ""mine.""

An era of perfection would be attained within the framework of earthly life and human history--and by the hand of mortal human beings. This epoch was to be preceded by terrible wars, and the Antichrist would appear. Joachim saw proof of this in the decay of the Church in his time.

"Pointing out the tragic facts that so frequently have accompanied the socialist experiments of the twentieth century usually evokes the objection that an idea cannot be judged by the unsuccessful attempts at its implementation. The task of rebuilding society is so immeasurably complicated, it is said, that in the initial stages errors are inevitable; they are, however, due to the shortcomings of certain individuals or the heritage of the past; in no sense do they follow from the fine principles enunciated by the founders of the doctrine. The fact that even in the earliest declarations of socialist doctrine there are schemes which in their cruelty far exceed any real system is dismissed as insignificant. It is argued that the determining factor is real life and hardly the constructions of theoreticians or the fantasy of utopian thinkers. Life, it is said, has its own laws. It will temper and smooth out the extremes of the fanatics and create a social structure which, even if it does not quite correspond to their original plans, will be at least viable, and in any case closer to perfection than that which now exists.",The Socialist Phenomenon by Igor Shafarevich,Igor Shafarevich,,,,,order,5,2018-07-20 12:47:38+00:00

Socialism seeks to reduce human personality to its most primitive levels and to extinguish the highest, most complex, and ""God-like"" aspects of human individuality.

"This demand is encountered in almost all socialist doctrines. Its negative form is seen in the striving to destroy the hierarchy of the surrounding society and in calls ""to humble the proud, the rich and the powerful,"" to abolish privilege. This tendency frequently gives rise to hostility toward culture as a factor contributing to spiritual and intellectual inequality and, as a result, leads to a call for the destruction of culture itself.",The Socialist Phenomenon by Igor Shafarevich,Igor Shafarevich,,,,,order,73,2018-08-16 11:29:26+00:00
"The fundamental nature of this principle is emphasized, for instance, by Marx and Engels: ""The theory of Communism may be summed up in a single sentence: 'Abolition of private property,'"" (Communist Manifesto).

This proposition, in its negative form, is inherent in all socialist doctrines without exception and is the basic feature of all socialist states. But in its positive form, as an assertion about the actual nature of property in a socialist society, it is less universal and appears in two distinct variants: the overwhelming majority of socialist doctrines proclaim the communality of property (implemented in more or less radical fashion), while socialist states (and some doctrines) are based on state property.",The Socialist Phenomenon by Igor Shafarevich,Igor Shafarevich,,,,,order,71,2018-08-16 11:25:35+00:00

"A striking picture emerges of a movement that lasted for fifteen centuries despite persecution by the dominant Church and by secular authorities.* A precisely fixed set of religious ideas affecting the general attitude toward life was preserved virtually unchanged, often down to the smallest detail. Throughout this period, the tradition of secret ordination of bishops was unbroken; general questions of import to the movement were decided at ""synods,"" and wandering Apostles took the decrees to distant societies. On admittance to the sect, the initiates were given new names known only to their closed group. Secret signs were used (for instance, when shaking hands) so the brethren could recognize one another. Houses were also marked by secret signs so that traveling members could find accommodations with their kind. Among the sectarians it was said that you could travel from England to Rome, staying only at houses of fellow sectarians along the way. There were close ties among the national branches of the movement. Synods were attended by representatives from allover Western arId Central Europe; literature was sent from country to country. There was mutual financial assistance during times of calamity; people would stream in from other countries to help their brethren",The Socialist Phenomenon by Igor Shafarevich,Igor Shafarevich,,,,,order,20,2018-07-26 12:00:27+00:00

All forms of participation in public life and entertainment were forbidden. Anabaptists were called ""monks without hoods."" The leaders of the Anabaptist community in Zurich preached that ""all property must be held in common and together."" These events were accompanied by strange happenings. Members of some of the groups went naked at their gatherings and, to be like children, crept around on the ground, playing. Others burned the Bible, and with shouts of ""Here!

"Jon Elster’s contribution to the history of methodological individualism must be understood against this background. He presents the doctrine as part of a friendly yet trenchant critique of the use of functionalist explanations in the Marxist tradition; particularly those that seek to explain events as ones that “serve the interests of capital.” The problem with these explanations, Elster argues, is that they “postulate a purpose without a purposive actor” (1982, 452) ... Thus what made Elster’s attack so forceful was not the accusation of objective teleology in Marxist theory, but rather the suggestion that much of Marxian “class analysis” overlooked the potential for collective action problems among the various world-historical actors. ... An even more disturbing consequence of the “rational choice” perspective is the observation that the working class faces a major collective action problem when it comes to carrying out the socialist revolution (Elster 1982, 467). Fomenting revolution can be dangerous business, and so absent some other incentive (such as class solidarity), even workers who were convinced that a communist economic order would offer them a superior quality of life might still fail to show up at the barricades. ... For example, the stability of a belief in a population only very rarely depends upon its stability in individuals. There can be considerable volatility at the individual level, but so long as it runs with equal force both ways, its prevalence in the population will be unchanged (68). If ten per cent of the population loses their faith in God every year, yet ten per cent have a conversion experience, then there will be no change in the overall level of religiosity.

"At the same time, it is worth noting that too much emphasis on the action-theoretic perspective can generate its own fallacies. One of the most powerful resources of sociological inquiry is precisely the capacity to objectivate and aggregate social behavior using large-scale data collection and analysis. Furthermore, the analysis of social phenomena at this level can often generate results that are counterintuitive from an action-theoretic perspective. Too much emphasis on the action-theoretic perspective, because of its proximity to common sense, can generate false assumptions about what must be going on at the aggregate level.",Methodological Individualism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy),Heath Joseph,,.c1,,c1,order,15,2018-09-01 10:18:19+00:00

"A social science that aims at interpretation, or that uses interpretation as part of the centerpiece of its explanatory strategy, has a very clear methodological reason for privileging explanations that refer to individual actions – since it is precisely the underlying intentional states that serve as the object of interpretation. But if social scientists are merely in the business of providing causal explanations, just like natural scientists, then what is the rationale for privileging individual actions in these explanations? There no longer appears to be any methodological reason for doing so. Thus critics like Leon Goldstein (1958), and later Steven Lukes (1968), would argue that methodological individualism was actually just an oblique way of asserting a commitment to metaphysical or ontological individualism. In other words, Popper’s “methodological individualism” was actually a claim about what the world “really” consisted of, little more than a fancy way of saying “there is no such thing as society.” Watkins went on to reinforce this impression by reformulating the thesis as the claim that the “ultimate constituents of the social world are individual people” (1957, 105).",Methodological Individualism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy),Heath Joseph,,,,,order,5,2018-08-16 16:20:05+00:00
"The problem with ignoring the agent’s perspective, in Hayek’s view, is that it can easily lead us to overestimate our powers of rational planning and control, and thus to fall into “rationalism.” By contrast, the central virtue of methodological individualism is that it helps us to see the limitations of our own reason (Hayek 1944, 33). Formulating theories that refer directly to the “interest rate,” or “inflationary pressures,” or “the unemployment rate” can mislead us into thinking that we can manipulate these variables, and thus intervene successfully in the economy. We forget that these concepts are abstractions, used not to guide individual action, but rather to describe the net effect of millions of individual decisions. The key characteristic of methodological individualism is that it “systematically starts from the concepts which guide individuals in their actions and not from the results of their theorizing about their actions” (1942, 286). It therefore encourages, in Hayek’s view, greater modesty with respect to social planning.

Hayek does not mention methodological individualism after the 1950s. Indeed, the role that evolutionary explanations come to play in his later work implies a tacit retraction of his commitment to the doctrine.",Methodological Individualism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy),Heath Joseph,,,,,order,4,2018-08-16 16:14:06+00:00
"In Economy and Society, Weber articulates the central precept of methodological individualism in the following way: When discussing social phenomena, we often talk about various “social collectivities, such as states, associations, business corporations, foundations, as if they were individual persons”(Weber 1922, 13). Thus we talk about them having plans, performing actions, suffering losses, and so forth. The doctrine of methodological individualism does not take issue with these ordinary ways of speaking, it merely stipulates that “in sociological work these collectivities must be treated as solely the resultants and modes of organization of the particular acts of individual persons, since these alone can be treated as agents in a course of subjectively understandable action” (Weber 1922, 13).",Methodological Individualism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy),Heath Joseph,,,,,order,1,2018-08-16 15:52:11+00:00

"The argument for liberty is not an argument against organization, which is one of the most powerful means that human reason can em­ploy, but an argument against all exclusive, privileged, monopolistic organization, against the use of coercion to prevent others from trying to do better. Every organi­zation is based on given knowl­edge; organization means commit­ment to a particular aim and to particular methods, but even or­ganization designed to increase knowledge will be effective only in­sofar as the knowledge and beliefs on which its design rests are true. And if any facts contradict the beliefs on which the structure of the organization is based, this will become evident only in its failure and super session by a different type of organization.

Organization is therefore likely to be beneficial and effective so long as it is voluntary and is im­bedded in a free sphere and will either have to adjust itself to cir­cumstances not taken into account in its conception or fail.

"From this foundation of the argument for liberty it follows that we shall not achieve its ends if we confine liberty to the particular instances where we know it will do good. Freedom granted only when it is known beforehand that its effects will be beneficial is not freedom. If we knew how freedom would be used, the case for it would largely disappear. We shall never get the benefits of freedom, never obtain those unforeseeable new developments for which it pro­vides the opportunity, if it is not also granted where the uses made of it by some do not seem desir­able. It is therefore no argument against individual freedom that it is frequently abused. Freedom necessarily means that many things will be done which we do not like. Our faith in freedom does not rest on the foreseeable results in particular circumstances but on the belief that it will, on balance, release more forces for the good than for the bad.

It also follows that the import­ance of our being free to do a par­ticular thing has nothing to do with the question of whether we or the majority are ever likely to make use of that particular possibility. To grant no more freedom than all can exercise would be to mis­conceive its function completely. The freedom that will be used by only one man in a million may be more important to society and more beneficial to the majority than any freedom that we all use. It might even be said that the less likely the opportunity to make use of freedom to do a particular thing, the more precious it will be for society as a whole. The less likely the opportunity, the more serious will it be to miss it when it arises, for the experience that it offers will be nearly unique.

It is also probably true that the ma­jority are not directly interested in most of the important things that any one person should be free to do. It is because we do not know how individuals will use their free­dom that it is so important. If it were otherwise, the results of free­dom could also be achieved by the majority’s deciding what should be done by the individuals.

"The simplest and clearest description of asabiyah’s requirements is given by Lenn Evan Goodman in his essay “Ibn Khaldun and Thucydides”:
“The tragic fact of history, however, which Ibn Khaldun insists on bringing before us, is that __in politics whatever can be demanded will be demanded. Thus ‘asabiyya, whether in the nation or the tribe, becomes a matter of willingness to die.’__ It is because this is so that nations and tribes, and the families, states or dynasties which rule them, have finite lifespans. __Unless individuals are prepared to die for their group, the group itself will die.__"" [14]",Introducing: Asabiyah,scholars-stage.blogspot.com,,,,,order,3,2018-12-19 18:28:41+00:00
"Despite all these differences, Ibn Khaldun did articulate principles that remain relevant despite their age. The first and most important of these is that social cohesion should be understood as a vital element of national power. Wars are rarely won and strategies rarely made without it. A nation need not be engaged in existential conflict to benefit from strong asabiyah. Absent solidarity, internal controversies absorb the attention of statesmen and internal divisions derail all attempts to craft coherent policy. Strategic malaise is one byproduct of a community deficient in asabiyah. 

Ibn Khaldun offers few cures for this sorry state. He asserts instead that asabiyah is not and never will be an artificial invention. The fragility of despotic regimes maintained by blood and fear reflect this fact. No matter how dearly the despot may wish it, the most powerful forms of human cooperation cannot be produced by coercion. Indeed, the most powerful forms of cooperation cannot be produced at all. Ibn Khaldun's vision is pessimistic: great men may ride the waves of history but they cannot direct their force. Asabiyah will rise and fall as communities grow and then splinter, bureaucracies expand and then calcify, and laws are established but then too quickly multiply. What was constructed for the glory of a people in past ages only hampers their progress and hastens their decline in the present. All the good man can do in such a time of decline is wait for the old order to fall apart and join the asabiyah driven group of men and women ready to rebuild upon the ashes.",Introducing: Asabiyah,scholars-stage.blogspot.com,,,,,order,5,2018-12-19 18:53:25+00:00
"Thus in Khaldun’s view, asabiyah is not permanent. Almost inevitably, it dwindles away. The process can take generations, but the reason is always the same: “They have lost the sweetness of fame and asabiyah, because they are dominated by force.” [19] To use a rather rough analogy to make clear the point: a community may agree that it is a good and saintly thing to give alms to the poor. But once a government steps in and decides that they will tax the community in order to provide for the poor, the nature of the exchange changes. What was once a decision freely made in a spirit of charity becomes an act compelled by force, tolerated (at best!) or resented by the givers. The spirit gives way when a law is in place.

"Hobbes' dichotomy is not presented merely as a thought experiment, but as a description of how human society actually works. Herein lies Hobbes' greatest fault. Today we know a great deal about the inner workings of non-state societies, and they are not as Hobbes described them. The man without a state is not a man without a place; he is almost always part of a village, a tribe, a band, or a large extended family. He has friends, compatriots, and fellows that he trusts and is willing to sacrifice for. His behavior is constrained by the customs and mores of his community; he shares with this community ideas of right and wrong and is often bound quite strictly by the oaths he makes. He does cooperate with others. When he and his fellows have been mobilized in great enough numbers their strength has often shattered the more civilized societies arrayed before them. 

The social contract of Hobbes' imagination was premised on a flawed State of Nature. The truth is that there never has been a time when men and women lived without ties of kin and community to guide their deeds and restrain their excess, and thus there never could be a time when atomized individuals gathered together to surrender their liberty to a sovereign power. Hobbes mistake is understandable; both he and the social contract theorists that followed in his footsteps (as well as the Chinese philosophers who proposed something close to a state of nature several thousand years earlier) lived in an age where Leviathan was not only ascendent but long established.

"An army composed of self interested soldiers more concerned with their own appetites and advantage than the army's fate is an army that, other things being equal, will be defeated. The force that conquers or defends 'against all odds' is a force imbued with a spirit of solidarity whose strength is more compelling than naked self interest could ever be. This spirit of sacrifice and common cause may be the fruit of patriotic fervor or revolutionary zeal, though often it is simply the sort of battleground loyalty that turns a group of strangers into ""a band of brothers."" It is this feeling that compels the self interested man to lead the charge and hold fast the standard despite the seeming irrationality of his position. It is not an emotion that causes men to ignore or forget self interest so much as it is a virtue that causes them to identify their narrow passions with the greater cause. For as long as this conviction lasts, the soldier thus enraptured will believe sincerely that the army's gains are his gains and that the army's fate is his fate. Even in most desperate straits he will work with the strength and focus normally reserved for attaining private advantage, for in his mind the distinction between ""self interest"" and ""group interest"" will no longer be important.

The comparative stability of the aggregates cannot, however, be accounted for—as the statisticians occasionally seem to be inclined to do—by the ""law of large numbers"" or the mutual compensation of random changes. The number of elements with which we have to deal is not large enough for such accidental forces to produce stability. The continuous flow of goods and services is maintained by constant deliberate adjustments, by new dispositions made every day in the light of circumstances not known the day before, by B stepping in at once when A fails to deliver. Even the large and highly mechanized plant keeps going largely because of an environment upon which it can draw for all sorts of unexpected needs; tiles for its roof, stationery for its forms, and all the thousand and one kinds of equipment in which it cannot be self-contained and which the plans for the operation of the plant require to be readily available in the market.

This is, perhaps, also the point where I should briefly mention the fact that the sort of knowledge with which I have been concerned is knowledge of the kind which by its nature cannot enter into statistics and therefore cannot be conveyed to any central authority in statistical form. The statistics which such a central authority would have to use would have to be arrived at precisely by abstracting from minor differences between the things, by lumping together, as resources of one kind, items which differ as regards location, quality, and other particulars, in a way which may be very significant for the specific decision. It follows from this that central planning based on statistical information by its nature cannot take direct account of these circumstances of time and place and that the central planner will have to find some way or other in which the decisions depending on them can be left to the ""man on the spot.""",The Use of Knowledge in Society | F.

According to the University of Chicago’s Dana Rovang, Daesh filmmakers mimic well-known Hollywood narrative techniques, such as the “Hero’s Journey” plot progression, in order to cast their fighters as heroic martyrs [7].

"In the modern West, Marx is most popular in the least empirical and most politically driven academic tribes. This was not always so. In the 21st century, we have forgotten that the central appeal of Marxism to socialist revolutionaries was its claim to scientific validity. Marx, like the evolutionary psychologists, was committed to a naturalistic account of human affairs. Marx, also like the evolutionary psychologists, furiously denied that ideas and impulses have their origins in a ""realm of pure thought."" In words that could easily be uttered by any evolutionary psychologist today, he argued that ""from the start the “spirit” is afflicted with the curse of being “burdened” with matter,"" and that any science of human society must be built on a clear-eyed picture of the relationship between ideas, impulses, and emotions on the one hand, and their material foundations on the other.[7] Like evolutionary psychology today, part of Marx's appeal was an iconoclastic rejection of popular pieties for the sake of scientific explanation. He justified his works not in the language of justice, but of truth.

"Treating words as weapons in the struggle for survival is not a notion Stalin dreamed up alone. It is an idea with a sterling Marxist ancestry. It finds its' roots in the writings of young Karl Marx, who declared ""it is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness."" [2] As a materialist, Marx did not believe that human thought was autonomous. Marx maintained that a man's strongest convictions and most cherished opinions were not really his, but involuntary impulses of his material (read: class) background. Marx would state this idea most clearly in 
The production of ideas, of conceptions, of consciousness, is at first directly interwoven with the material activity and the material intercourse of men, the language of real life. Conceiving, thinking, the mental intercourse of men, appear at this stage as the direct efflux of their material behaviour. The same applies to mental production as expressed in the language of politics, laws, morality, religion, metaphysics, etc., of a people. Men are the producers of their conceptions, ideas, etc. – real, active men, as they are conditioned by a definite development of their productive forces and of the intercourse corresponding to these, up to its furthest forms. Consciousness can never be anything else than conscious existence, and the existence of men is their actual life-process. If in all ideology men and their circumstances appear upside-down as in a camera obscura, this phenomenon arises just as much from their historical life-process as the inversion of objects on the retina does from their physical life-process. 

In direct contrast to German philosophy which descends from heaven to earth, here we ascend from earth to heaven. That is to say, we do not set out from what men say, imagine, conceive, nor from men as narrated, thought of, imagined, conceived, in order to arrive at men in the flesh. We set out from real, active men, and on the basis of their real life-process we demonstrate the development of the ideological reflexes and echoes of this life-process. The phantoms formed in the human brain are also, necessarily, sublimates of their material life-process, which is empirically verifiable and bound to material premises. Morality, religion, metaphysics, all the rest of ideology and their corresponding forms of consciousness, thus no longer retain the semblance of independence. They have no history, no development; but men, developing their material production and their material intercourse, alter, along with this their real existence, their thinking and the products of their thinking.

""Honor"" is always a corporate possession. As anyone who lives in a contemporary honor culture can tell you, disgrace for one in the family is disgrace for all. The clan is the weapon through which blood feud is waged. There were practical reasons for this: if no one has family to retaliate for wrongs done to their kinsmen, then the simplest solution to perceived slight is to kill the offender and end all chance of future retaliation then and there.

"The high market value of well-prepared food is not the result of the value of the chef’s labor. Rather, the chef’s labor is valuable precisely because he is able to produce food that the public finds especially tasty, beautiful, or healthy.

On this view, labor gets rewarded according to its ability to produce things that others value. When you then consider the ways in which labor combining with capital enables that labor to produce goods that humans value even more, which in turn increases labor’s remuneration, Marx’s whole worldview is suddenly turned on its head. Capital does not exploit labor. Instead, it enhances labor’s value by giving labor the tools it needs to make even more of the things that humans value.

Understood correctly through the subjective theory of value, capitalism is fundamentally a communication process through which humans try to sort out how best to make use of our limited resources to satisfy our most urgent wants. Exchange and market prices are how we make our subjective perceptions of value accessible to others so they can figure out how best to provide us with the things we value most.",We're Still Haunted by the Labor Theory of Value | Steven Horwitz,fee.org,,,,,order,1,2019-08-28 01:27:36+00:00

What if our ancestors were right after all?

One great virtue of Persecution and Toleration is that it tackles this question head on. The answer, they argue, is that in an environment where religion is doing the heavy lifting in legitimizing the state, religious minorities will only be tolerated if either (1) the state is too weak to enforce homogeneity, or (2) that minority provides some important service that the majority cannot provide for itself.",Myth and Modernity: A Review of Persecution and Toleration – Liberal Currents,liberalcurrents.com,,,,,order,3,2019-07-11 16:42:05+00:00
"All this suggests that the common wisdom of premodern Europe had more truth to it than we care to admit today. In a situation where the only large-scale social orders the world had ever seen were invariably legitimated by religion, of course religious liberty would be an absurd prospect. Of course atheists would be untrustworthy. Religion – and not just religion in general, but a particular religion with specific content – was doing the work of holding together the social body, a point quite well grasped by the people in such a regime. Even if any particular individual would prefer not to believe, all else equal, he would also be well aware that a society where everyone (including himself) believed is preferable to a society where no one did.

This situation is what the book refers to as the conditional toleration equilibrium that characterized nearly the entire world prior to the late 17th century (or perhaps even later, by broader definitions), and still characterizes much of the developing world today. When social order relies on religious legitimation, any tolerance that might exist can only ever be conditional and pragmatic.

"The 21st century is not the first era Chinese have been offered a stark choice between success and virtue. If there is one theme that threads its way through the great sweep of the Chinese tradition, it is a tragic recognition that the world we live in is not designed to reward the life most worth living. It is found in the opening pages of Sima Qian's historical masterwork. It is coded into the biography of Confucius, and debated by all of his intellectual heirs. Attempts to reconcile the pressures of the world with the honest life were made by the Mohist philosophers; the attempt was proclaimed impossible by both Daoists and Legalists (though for opposite reasons). The first named poet in Chinese history is survived by one poem, a lament on this theme. Be it the rural escapes of Tao Qian, the drunken withdrawals of Li Bai, or the stubborn realism of Du Fu, this dilemma inspired the greatest of China's poets in the millennia that followed. The great Chinese novels are obsessed with the topic: Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Outlaws of the Marsh ask if one can live righteously in ages of corruption and violence; The Scholars (and less obviously, viciously satire those who try to do the same in ages of corruption and peace.

This injunction was much stronger for males than for females…”[24] The Ache hunter-gatherers of Paraguay don’t have a men’s cult; however, their social organization does exhibit some similarities in this regard.

The real possibilities of human freedom are relative to the attained stage of civilization. They depend on the material and intellectual resources available at the respective stage, and they are quantifiable and calculable to a high degree. So are, at the stage of advanced industrial society, the most rational ways of using these resources and distributing the social product with priority on the satisfaction of vital needs and with a minimum of toil and injustice. In other words, it is possible to define the direction in which prevailing institutions, policies, opinions would have to be changed in order to improve the chance of a peace which is not identical with cold war and a little hot war, and a satisfaction of needs which does not feed on poverty, oppression, and exploitation. Consequently, it is also possible to identify policies, opinions, movements which would promote this chance, and those which would do the opposite.

"By whom, and according to what standards, can the political distinction between true and false, progressive and regressive (for in this sphere, these pairs are equivalent) be made and its validity be justified? At the outset, I propose that the question cannot be answered in terms of the alternative between democracy and dictatorship, according to which, in the latter, one individual or group, without any effective control from below, arrogate to themselves the decision. Historically, even in the most democratic democracies, the vital and final decisions affecting the society as a whole have been made, constitutionally or in fact, by one or several groups without effective control by the people themselves. The ironical question: who educates the educators (i.e. the political leaders) also applies to democracy. The only authentic alternative and negation of dictatorship (with respect to this question) would be a society in which 'the people' have become autonomous individuals, freed from the repressive requirements of a struggle for existence in the interest of domination, and as such human beings choosing their government and determining their life. Such a society does not yet exist anywhere. In the meantime, the question must be treated in abstracto--abstraction, not from the historical possibilities, but from the realities of the prevailing societies.","Repressive Tolerance, by Herbert Marcuse (1965)",marcuse.org,,,,,order,6,2018-11-13 01:38:54+00:00

The question is whether this is the only alternative.

"Under a system of constitutionally guaranteed and (generally and without too many and too glaring exceptions) practiced civil rights and liberties, opposition and dissent are tolerated unless they issue in violence and/or in exhortation to and organization of violent subversion. The underlying assumption is that the established society is free, and that any improvement, even a change in the social structure and social values, would come about in the normal course of events, prepared, defined, and tested in free and equal discussion, on the open marketplace of ideas and goods.[2] Now in recalling John Stuart Mill's passage, I drew attention to the premise hidden in this assumption: free and equal discussion can fulfill the function attributed to it only if it is rational expression and development of independent thinking, free from indoctrination, manipulation, extraneous authority. The notion of pluralism and countervailing powers is no substitute for this requirement. One might in theory construct a state in which a multitude of different pressures, interests, and authorities balance each other out and result in a truly general and rational interest. However, such a construction badly fits a society in which powers are and remain unequal and even increase their unequal weight when they run their own course. It fits even worse when the variety of pressures unifies and coagulates into an overwhelming whole, integrating the particular countervailing powers by virtue of an increasing standard of living and an increasing concentration of power. Then, the laborer, whose real interest conflicts with that of management, the common consumer whose real interest conflicts with that of the producer, the intellectual whose vocation conflicts with that of his employer find themselves submitting to a system against which they are powerless and appear unreasonable. The idea of the available alternatives evaporates into an utterly utopian dimension in which it is at home, for a free society is indeed unrealistically and undefinably different from the existing ones. Under these circumstances, whatever improvement may occur 'in the normal course of events' and without subversion is likely to be an improvement in the direction determined by the particular interests which control the whole.","Repressive Tolerance, by Herbert Marcuse (1965)",marcuse.org,,,,,order,1,2018-11-10 21:59:01+00:00
"Democracy is a form of government which fits very different types of society (this holds true even for a democracy with universal suffrage and equality before the law), and the human costs of a democracy are always and everywhere those exacted by the society whose government it is. Their range extends all the way from normal exploitation, poverty, and insecurity to the victims of wars, police actions, military aid, etc., in which the society is engaged--and not only to the victims within its own frontiers. These considerations can never justify the exacting of different sacrifices and different victims on behalf of a future better society, but they do allow weighing the costs involved in the perpetuation of an existing society against the risk of promoting alternatives which offer a reasonable chance of pacification and liberation. Surely, no government can be expected to foster its own subversion, but in a democracy such a right is vested in the people (i.e. in the majority of the people). This means that the ways should not be blocked on which a subversive majority could develop, and if they are blocked by organized repression and indoctrination, their reopening may require apparently undemocratic means. They would include the withdrawal of toleration of speech and assembly from groups and movements which promote aggressive policies, armament, chauvinism, discrimination on the grounds of race and religion, or which oppose the extension of public services, social security, medical care, etc. Moreover, the restoration of freedom of thought may necessitate new and rigid restrictions on teachings and practices in the educational institutions which, by their very methods and concepts, serve to enclose the mind within the established universe of discourse and behavior--thereby precluding a priori a rational evaluation of the alternatives. And to the degree to which freedom of thought involves the struggle against inhumanity, restoration of such freedom would also imply intolerance toward scientific research in the interest of deadly 'deterrents', of abnormal human endurance under inhuman conditions, etc. I shall presently discuss the question as to who is to decide on the distinction between liberating and repressive, human and inhuman teachings and practices; I have already suggested that this distinction is not a matter of value-preference but of rational criteria.","Repressive Tolerance, by Herbert Marcuse (1965)",marcuse.org,,,,,order,3,2018-11-11 13:08:04+00:00

"Henrich makes two arguments here, both relevant to contemporary debates in politics and philosophy. The first is that customs, traditions, and the like are subject to Darwinian selection. Henrich is not always clear on exactly what is being selected for—is it individuals who follow a tradition, groups whose members all follow the tradition, or the tradition itself?—but the general gist is that traditions stick around longest when they are adaptive. This process is ""blind."" Those who follow the traditions do not know how they work, and in some cases (like religious rituals that build social solidarity) knowing the details of how they work might actually reduce the efficacy of the tradition. That is the second argument of note: we do not (and often cannot) understand just how the traditions we inherit help our survival, and because of that, it is difficult to artificially create replacements. 

I do not think Henrich is willing to extend these points to all elements of human culture. If we are to take analogies with genetic evolution seriously, then we should not be surprised if a large amount of our cultural baggage are just random accretions passed on from one generation to the next—in essence, the cultural version of genetic drift.

"I say ahistorically because the author is not nearly the first socialist to tout the increased “democracy” his revolution would supposedly harken in. Here’s Vladimir Lenin on the features of proletarian (not bourgeois) democracy:

The Soviet form of organisation automatically helps to unite all the working and exploited people around their vanguard, the proletariat. The old bourgeois apparatus—the bureaucracy, the privileges of wealth, of bourgeois education, of social connections, etc.—all this disappears under the Soviet form of organisation. Freedom of the press ceases to be hypocrisy, because the printing-plants and stocks of paper are taken away from the bourgeoisie. The same thing applies to the best buildings, the palaces, the mansions and manorhouses.

Soviet power took thousands upon thousands of these best buildings from the exploiters at one stroke, and in this way made the right of assembly—without which democracy is a fraud—a million times more democratic for the people. Indirect elections to non-local Soviets make it easier to hold congresses of Soviets, they make the entire apparatus less costly, more flexible, more accessible to the workers and peasants at a time when life is seething and it is necessary to be able very quickly to recall one’s local deputy or to delegate him to a general congress of Soviets.

Proletarian democracy is a million times more democratic than any bourgeois democracy; Soviet power is a million times more democratic than the most democratic bourgeois republic. To fail to see this one must either deliberately serve the bourgeoisie, or be politically as dead as a doornail, unable to see real life from behind the dusty pages of bourgeois books, be thoroughly imbued with bourgeois-democratic prejudices, and thereby objectively convert oneself into a lackey of the bourgeoisie.",Democratic Socialism Threatens All Minorities,Conor Friedersdorf,,,,,order,1,2018-08-13 11:22:08+00:00

There is a strangeness in watching the demos in every country repeatedly reject what one believes to be just for decades, in favor of what one believes to be monstrously unjust, yet nevertheless believing that if the same demos is put under democratic socialism, it will render reliably just judgments about how an entire society should produce and consume.

"From a purely logical point of view, what scientists do when they blame the failure of a prediction on the background assumptions instead of theory they take to be well-established is no different from what charlatans peddling pseudoscience do when they conjure up bizarre hypotheses to explain away evidence that seem to contradict their theories, as when creationists posit that God planted fossils that seem very ancient to test our faith. The difference is that, when pseudoscientists do that, the hypotheses they conjure up are purely ad hoc and meant to protect theories that were never well-established in the first place and lack the kind of theoretical virtues that good theories have, but there is no purely formal criterion that allows you to decide that in a simple way. This is why the search for such a criterion of demarcation between science and non-science, whether in terms of falsifiability or not, is probably hopeless.

"A crop failure in 1920, followed by a heavy frost and a swelteringly hot summer, were serious natural disasters. However, the catastrophe the following year was caused more by man than by nature. The main reason was Lenin’s continued policy of grain requisitioning. Peasants had been used to maintaining stocks to see themselves through times of bad harvests. Now they grew just enough for subsistence, to feed their livestock and to keep sufficient seed to sow the next harvest. What was the point of producing more if the Bolsheviks took it all? By 1920 the sown area of the Volga region had declined by 25 per cent in three years. When a poor harvest came there were no reserves of stock. ... Cannibalism was common. People were storing corpses as food. One woman was caught with her child eating pieces of her dead husband. When police interviewed her she said, ‘We won’t give him up…he is our own family and no one has the right to take him away from us.’ There were several cases of mothers killing one of their children in order to feed the others.","Lenin: The Man, the Dictator, and the Master of Terror",Victor Sebestyen,B06WLJZNBH,,yellow,,location,9101,2020-02-26 04:56:00+00:00

"But he took the establishment of the Comintern (Communist International) seriously. This was to be the group of socialist parties throughout Western Europe and the US that would spark the revolutions – as the Bolsheviks had done in Russia. The idea was based on his version of a Marxist principle: ‘The interests of socialism, of world socialism, are superior to national interests, the interests of the State.’ But, as so often, Lenin’s need to control organisations, centralise them and dominate them turned the principle on its head. The Comintern was run from Moscow and soon became a branch of Soviet foreign policy. Its founding rules stated that if members wanted to be considered Communist Parties, if they wanted any help or support from Russia, all had to be Leninist-type organisations run like the Bolsheviks. They must expel from their ranks ‘moderates and centrists’; they had to try to take over trade unions; and they had to toe the Moscow line on almost everything.

Nothing so hindered the White movement as this condition of psychologically staying put…in circumstances that ceased to exist. Men with this ancien régime mentality were immersed in this raging sea of revolutionary anarchy and could not find their bearings.

Most of the early Bolsheviks had long experience of the Okhrana’s methods and the Cheka copied many of them, such as infiltrating opposition groups, using agents provocateurs and recruiting double agents. While the Red Army would later enrol former Tsarist officers in its ranks, the Cheka did not do the same with former Okhrana agents. Dzerzhinsky, Lenin, Sverdlov and Stalin all argued that they simply couldn’t be trusted. The Cheka had to start from scratch and learn how to organise an espionage agency. Marx and Engels had left no blueprint; the Okhrana had. Lenin was interested in the technical details of its operations. It was he, in a note to Dzerzhinsky soon after the Cheka was set up, who suggested that ‘it would be useful to carry out arrests at night’. The knock at the door in the small hours became the classic modus operandi of ‘the organs’ throughout the Communist years.2","Lenin: The Man, the Dictator, and the Master of Terror",Victor Sebestyen,B06WLJZNBH,,yellow,,location,7201,2020-02-20 04:56:00+00:00
"The State would take over ownership of the presses and all the newsprint. The new government would allot the resources ‘equitably’. Political parties would be given a share and any groups of citizens would be guaranteed access to a nationalised printing plant if they were able to collect a given number of signatures for a newspaper of their own. ‘This will provide real freedom of the press for all and not just for the rich. It will act for the people’s enlightenment and not for their stultification and deception.’ When there were murmurs of dissent among his clique he said, ‘there’s a unanimous chorus from those jackals. Aren’t we going to bridle this rabble? The bourgeois press is a weapon no less dangerous than bombs or guns aimed at us. Why should we place it in their hands?’ Around the same time he shocked Emma Goldman by telling her that ‘free speech is a bourgeois prejudice, a soothing plaster for social ills. In the workers’ republic, economic well-being talks louder than speech.’3","Lenin: The Man, the Dictator, and the Master of Terror",Victor Sebestyen,B06WLJZNBH,,yellow,,location,6792,2020-02-20 04:56:00+00:00
"At first the Cheka had fewer than forty staff, based in a ramshackle office on the fourth floor of a scruffy building on Gorokhovaya, not far from Nevsky Prospekt. Dzerzhinsky kept what files the Cheka possessed in his briefcase and placed a notice on a wall close to the door: ‘Death to the Bourgeoisie’.*3 Within three months there were 600 staff, excluding its own blue-uniformed security troops, which numbered around 300 by the spring of 1918. Originally, according to Lenin’s decree, ‘the Commission will carry out only a preliminary investigation in so far as this is necessary for preventive purposes’. But almost immediately it went far beyond these powers and, without legal authorisation, moved from investigation to execution. The Cheka could easily do so because it had Lenin’s protection, and virtually nobody knew what its powers were. Its officials could make them up as they went along. Soon, it was a state within the State.","Lenin: The Man, the Dictator, and the Master of Terror",Victor Sebestyen,B06WLJZNBH,,yellow,,location,7181,2020-02-20 04:56:00+00:00
"In Lenin’s words, the Cheka’s job was to ‘investigate and liquidate all attempts or actions connected with counter-revolution or sabotage, no matter from whom they come, throughout Russia’. But its functions and powers were not made public until the mid-1920s, and from the first it operated outside the law under top-secret protocols with virtually no political accountability.

Giant multinational technology companies ‘freeze out other competition to forestall independent technological innovation’. Financial control ‘has passed from the industrialists themselves to a handful of banking conglomerates – the creation of a banking oligarchy’. There were few territories left for rising powers like the US to exploit. They had no alternative but to resort to militarisation and war. ‘National independence movements…will have to be crushed in an endless cycle to maintain their markets. This movement for national independence threatens…capital in its most valuable and promising fields of exploitation, and capital can maintain its dominance only by continually increasing its military forces.’ These were points made as much on the Right as the Left in 2017 – especially the dangers to the economy of a ‘banking oligarchy’ and the monopoly aims of the technology corporations.","Lenin: The Man, the Dictator, and the Master of Terror",Victor Sebestyen,B06WLJZNBH,,yellow,,location,5007,2020-02-16 04:56:00+00:00

He predicted with remarkable accuracy what was likely to happen: ‘The trouble will start with the blaming of the government for all disasters. In the legislative institutions a bitter campaign against the government will begin, followed by revolutionary agitation throughout the country, with socialist slogans, capable of arousing and rallying the masses, beginning with the division of the land and succeeded by a division of all valuables and property.

"Lenin’s cynicism was mind-boggling. At this point there was absolutely no chance that an armed uprising could succeed and he knew it. He was expecting sacrifices – possibly death – from his supporters. For a start, there were far too few of them to make any difference.

"The proximate cause of the split was of a ‘how many angels can dance on a pinhead?’ type. Lenin and Martov each proposed a list of membership criteria for the Party. Lenin’s stated that a member was someone who ‘accepted the Party programme and supports it by material means and by personal participation in one of the Party’s organisations’. This was too authoritarian for Martov. After quickly looking over Lenin’s resolution he told him, ‘but that’s dictatorship you’re proposing’. Lenin replied, ‘Yes, there’s no other way.’ Martov proposed an amendment. A member ‘recognises the Party programme and supports it by material means and by regular personal assistance under the direction of one of the Party’s organisations’. Martov won the vote by twenty-eight votes to twenty-three. At this point he had the support of one of the largest groups within the Party, the organisation of Jewish socialists known as the Bund (the name means ‘Union’ in Yiddish). There followed a series of divisive votes on smaller matters. At one point the five Bundist delegates walked out, as did the Union of Russian Social Democrats, which had two votes in the Congress. The balance had shifted, and Lenin seized his opportunity. The next vote was on removing some members of the ‘old guard’ from the board of Iskra – Axelrod, Zasulich, Potresov, all of whom had voted with Martov. This time Lenin won the vote and, with his characteristic mastery of tactics and presentation – spin in present-day language – he branded his followers ‘bolchintsvo’, the majority, and his opponents ‘menchintsvo’, the minority. For the following decades, up to the Stalin era, the Russian Revolution was played out amid the rivalries of the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks.","Lenin: The Man, the Dictator, and the Master of Terror",Victor Sebestyen,B06WLJZNBH,,yellow,,location,2912,2020-02-05 04:56:00+00:00
"His self-belief and confidence were unshakeable. Splitting the Party and splitting again, going into a political wilderness, would seem a hopeless route to take for a tiny group with little popular support. But in the long term – and Lenin was always looking at the bigger picture and the longer term – the tactic paid off. In his calculation, it did not matter so much how many supporters he had. The important thing was to have a group of people, a Party, loyal to him, of disciplined and dedicated supporters who would spread the true word. ‘I don’t want people with indeterminate views and shilly-shallyers. Better a small fish than a big beetle. Better two or three energetic and completely devoted men than a dozen dawdlers,’ he told Nadya. Those few who followed him ‘hero-worshipped him in a cloying kind of way,’ commented one of them who later defected from Lenin’s camp, ‘never doubting him. It didn’t seem healthy.’*1","Lenin: The Man, the Dictator, and the Master of Terror",Victor Sebestyen,B06WLJZNBH,"Like Taleb's ""minority rule""",yellow,,location,3022,2020-02-05 04:56:00+00:00
"The principal appeal Lenin held for his followers was not due to the strength of his indomitable will, his manifest brainpower or his brilliance as a political tactician, though all three were crucially important in his claim to be a leader. His greatest skill in his early years was his ability to inspire optimism and hope. He told his followers that they could change the world in the here and now, if they followed a set of essentially simple-to-comprehend steps and believed in a few fairly straightforward propositions. He didn’t offer salvation in the afterlife but a glimpse of heaven in the immediate future – or at least the achievement of some of their goals. Marxism is supposed to be a ‘scientific’ philosophy which can be ‘proven’ empirically. But any true Communist zealot, deny it though they may, felt it emotionally, religiously, spiritually, even if those words would have stuck in the gullet of a true believer. Lenin would most definitely have denied it. But as one of his oldest comrades, Potresov, who knew him in St Petersburg in the early 1890s during his earliest revolutionary days, said, ‘for Vladimir Ilyich Marxism was not a conviction, but a religion’. Many others made the same point, at least until the 1917 Revolution.","Lenin: The Man, the Dictator, and the Master of Terror",Victor Sebestyen,B06WLJZNBH,,yellow,,location,2705,2020-02-05 04:56:00+00:00

"Lenin loathed the very idea of a commune – all the more so after he visited the rooms in a near-derelict house in King’s Cross shared by Martov, Vera Zasulich and assorted young revolutionaries who popped in and out of the building at any time of the day or night. Tidy and ordered in his habits, he was appalled at what he found. Martov and Zasulich were notoriously messy, so he had some warning. But nothing prepared him for the chaos he encountered. Their living room was wreathed in smoke. Martov’s pipe ash found its way into the sugar bowl. Zasulich’s roll-your-own cigarettes settled on window sills, tables, teacups, herself, and occasionally on the person she was talking to. Her cooking methods were unorthodox even by Nadya’s standards. ‘I remember once how she cooked herself some meat on an oil stove, chipping off pieces to eat with a pair of scissors,’ she recalled after one visit. ‘Someone asked her how long the meat would take to cook. She said, “If I am hungry and in a hurry ten minutes, if not maybe three hours.” She wasn’t joking.’","Lenin: The Man, the Dictator, and the Master of Terror",Victor Sebestyen,B06WLJZNBH,,yellow,,location,2533,2020-02-05 04:56:00+00:00

I should go mad if I had to live like Martov and Zasulich. This was not a home, but more a public thoroughfare. Martov could be with people all day.

For only Lenin embodied…a personage of iron will, indomitable energy, combining a fanatical faith in the movement, in the cause, with as great a faith in himself. Louis XIV could say “I am the State”; so Lenin without unnecessary words invariably felt that he was the Party, that he was the will of the movement concentrated into one person. And he acted accordingly.’10","Lenin: The Man, the Dictator, and the Master of Terror",Victor Sebestyen,B06WLJZNBH,,yellow,,location,2346,2020-02-05 04:56:00+00:00
"It is true that the penal regime in Tsarist Russia was not as harsh as the Bolshevik system would be, and the Okhrana less bloodthirsty than Lenin’s Cheka. But we are dealing with degrees here, not categories. Thousands of ‘subversives’ died of disease, neglect and starvation in Siberian exile and jail for the ‘crime’ of reading or publishing banned literature, which often included nothing more radical than articles proposing mildly liberal democratic reforms in Russia that were common elsewhere in Europe. Many were executed, without a trial of any kind. In particular, the secret police were always on the lookout for illegal printing presses, which were closely guarded secrets that very few activists knew about. ‘Copies’ of Iskra could be reproduced on them, along with other material the Okhrana thought dangerous. In September 1901 a young Georgian revolutionary, Lado Ketskhoveli, acquired a sophisticated (and expensive) rotary press in Tiflis. He was arrested and the secret police tortured him mercilessly for several days to find out where the machine was located. But he wouldn’t tell them. He was shot in his prison cell.*7, 9","Lenin: The Man, the Dictator, and the Master of Terror",Victor Sebestyen,B06WLJZNBH,,yellow,,location,2278,2020-02-05 04:56:00+00:00

It contained the essence of what would be called Leninism and the principal tactics he and his Bolsheviks would use to build support and seize power. He told workers: ‘Do not merely organise yourselves into mutual aid societies, strike funds and workers’ circles. Organise yourselves for a close struggle against autocratic government and against the whole of capitalist society. Without such an organisation the proletariat is not capable of rising to a conscious class struggle…Without such an organisation the workers’ movement is condemned to impotence.

"From his first days in the dissident salons of St Petersburg he worked out a method that marked him as different from other radical agitators; almost single-handedly he changed the language on the revolutionary Left, which followed the coarse and aggressive pattern laid down by him. For generations throughout the Communist world, harsh invective and abuse characterised political debate among so-called comrades – let alone between ideological opponents. The exchange of insults was justified on the grounds that this was how Lenin had done things. It was the Soviet way, inspired by the founder of the state, who created so much of the USSR’s language, its lifestyle and political ‘culture’. His successors well after the Stalin era adopted this method of derision. Communist Parties everywhere, even following the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, learned that it made sense to play the man, not the ball – and how to do it with ruthless efficiency. It was one of the principal lessons of Leninism: ‘The harshness of polemics became settled Bolshevik practice,’ as one of his chief critics put it, ‘and the translation of words into corresponding action, physical violence to complement verbal brutality, was no more than a logical end to the process…It was a manner of argument peculiarly suited to Vladimir Ilyich’s personality.’","Lenin: The Man, the Dictator, and the Master of Terror",Victor Sebestyen,B06WLJZNBH,Leninthink,yellow,,location,1637,2020-02-04 04:56:00+00:00

"In Soviet mythology for decades to come, the Revolution was portrayed as a popular rising of the masses. Nothing could be further from the truth. Contemporary photographs show a few isolated spots around the city where a handful of Red Guards were milling about casually. There were no big crowds anywhere, no barricades, no street fighting. It is impossible to know how many people took part in the few isolated parts of the city which mattered during the insurrection. Trotsky estimated ‘no more’ than 25,000, but by that he meant the number of Red Guards he could have called out. The real number was far fewer – probably 10,000 at most, in a city numbering nearly two million. There was no ‘storming’ of the palace, as depicted in Sergei Eisenstein’s epic, cinematically brilliant but largely fictional 1928 film October.

The effect of the gangs was to suppress violence, increase trade in drugs and other goods, lower prices, and generally improve the inmates’ lives.

The appearance of gangs was a solution to the lack of governance among convicts.__ The prison officials generally welcomed the gangs, knowing that they helped to maintain order. __And the reason gangs did not form in female prisons was simply because their population was still small enough for norms, codes of conduct, to work instead.

"In the arts you can detect the shift quite clearly. In the early part of the nineteenth century many poets, novelists and playwrights were ardent supporters of classical liberalism, free trade and limited government. See the works of Schiller, Goethe and Byron. Giuseppe Verdi’s Rigoletto and Aida contain very liberal narratives about the nature of power. The open commercial society had liberated artists from the system of patronage, as they were able to sell their works in a mass market rather than rely on a wealthy individual. However, as time went on, many artists became hostile to liberalism, seeing bourgeois society as stultifying. The critics of the liberal order included Henrik Ibsen, Gustave Flaubert and Emile Zola. These opponents played an important role in portraying the liberal order in a negative light. The true radicals, the people with a vision of liberty and change, people like Cobden and Mill and Herbert Spencer, were then quite unfairly dumped on the ‘right’. Nobody would have thought them right-wing in their time – they were pacifists, egalitarians, feminists, liberals, internationalists, religious free thinkers.

"For those, like me, brought up to think of British imperialism as generally benign compared with other forms of the habit, the story gets worse. As recounted by Robert Zubrin in his book Merchants of Despair, in 1877 a dreamy and Bohemian poet with an opium habit named Robert Bulwer-Lytton was serving as Viceroy of India, sent there by his friend the Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli. Bulwer-Lytton may sound like a harmless if high-born hippie, but unfortunately he was a Malthusian – or his advisers were. A drought afflicted some parts of the country. There was still plenty of food in India as a whole – food exports doubled and doubled again in two years – but taxes and the devaluation of the rupee left the hungry unable to afford relief. Bulwer-Lytton quoted almost directly from Malthus in his response: ‘The Indian population has a tendency to increase more rapidly than the food it raises from the soil.’ His policy was to herd the hungry into camps where they were fed on – literally – starvation rations (slightly fewer calories per head than would be handed out in Nazi concentration camps), with the result that 94 per cent died each month. Bulwer-Lytton specifically halted several private attempts to bring relief to the starving. The justification of his government was that it was being cruel to be kind, because Malthusian ends justified harsh means.

"Still more surprising to many people is that in conditions of greater economic equality, IQ becomes more heritable, not less. In a world of more ample and more equally distributed food, obesity becomes more heritable, not less. This is because where many go hungry, fortune will largely determine who gets fat. Once everybody has enough food, the ones who get fat will be the ones with a genetic tendency to do so, and fatness will appear to run more in families – to be more heritable. The same with intelligence. Once everybody gets a similarly good education, the high achievers will increasingly be found among the children of high achievers, rather than the children of those with the best resources. It follows that a high correlation between the achievements of parents and their children, far from indicating that the parents are giving their children unfair environmental advantages, indicates instead that opportunity is being gradually levelled. Professor Plomin says that ‘heritability can be viewed as an index of meritocratic social mobility’, an idea that many people find counterintuitive.

"Who’s resorting to a skyhook here? Not Ohno or Dawkins or Gregory. They are saying the extra DNA just comes about, there not being sufficient selective incentive for the organism to clear out its genomic attic. (Admittedly, the idea of junk in your attic that duplicates itself if you do nothing about it is moderately alarming!) Bacteria, with large populations and brisk competition to grow faster than their rivals, generally do keep their genomes clear of junk. Large organisms do not. Yet there is clearly a yearning that many people have to prefer an explanation that sees the spare DNA as having a purpose for us, not for itself. As Graur puts it, the junk critics have fallen prey to ‘the genomic equivalent of the human propensity to see meaningful patterns in random data’.",The Evolution of Everything: How New Ideas Emerge,Matt Ridley,B00U1T9OSO,,yellow,,location,1341,2019-11-13 04:56:00+00:00
"In the 1960s, as I mentioned earlier, molecular biologists began to notice that there seemed to be far more DNA in a cell than was necessary to make all the proteins in the cell. Even with what turned out to be a vastly overinflated estimate of the number of genes in the human genome – then thought to be more than 100,000, now known to be about 20,000 – genes and their control sequences could account for only a small percentage of the total weight of DNA present in a cell’s chromosomes, at least in mammals. It’s less than 3 per cent in people. Worse, there was emerging evidence that we human beings did not seem to have the heaviest genomes or the most DNA. Humble protozoa, onions and salamanders have far bigger genomes. Grasshoppers have three times as much; lungfish forty times as much. Known by the obscure name of the ‘c-value paradox’, this enigma exercised the minds of some of the most eminent scientists of the day. One of them, Susumu Ohno, coined the term ‘junk DNA’, arguing that much of the DNA might not be under selection – that is to say, might not be being continuously honed by evolution to fit a function of the body. He was not saying it was garbage. As Sydney Brenner later made plain, people everywhere make the distinction between two kinds of rubbish: ‘garbage’ which has no use and must be disposed of lest it rot and stink, and ‘junk’, which has no immediate use but does no harm and is kept in the attic in case it might one day be put back to use.

"It turns out that Dawkins was right. What would his theory predict? That the spare DNA would have features that made it good at getting itself duplicated and re-inserted into chromosomes. Bingo. The commonest gene in the human genome is the recipe for reverse transcriptase, an enzyme that the human body has little or no need for, and whose main function is usually to help the spread of retroviruses. Yet there are more copies and half-copies of this gene than of all other human genes combined. Why? Because reverse transcriptase is a key part of any DNA sequence that can copy itself and distribute the copies around the genome. It’s a sign of a digital parasite. Most of the copies are inert these days, and some are even put to good use, helping to regulate real genes or bind proteins. But they are there because they are good at being there.",The Evolution of Everything: How New Ideas Emerge,Matt Ridley,B00U1T9OSO,Wow!

Here’s one, right away: the idea that genes are recipes patiently waiting to be used by the cook that is the body. The collective needs of the whole organism are what the genes are there to serve, and they are willing slaves. You find this assumption behind almost any description of genetics – including ones by me – yet it is misleading. For it is just as truthful to turn the image upside down. The body is the plaything and battleground of genes at least as much as it is their purpose. Whenever somebody asks what a certain gene is for, they automatically assume that the question relates to the needs of the body: what is it for, in terms of the body’s needs?

"That, after all, is how the immune system works. It does not just produce the best antibodies it can find; it sets out to experiment and evolve in real time. Human beings cannot expect to rely upon evolving resistance to parasites quickly enough by the selective death of susceptible people, because our generation times are too long. We have to allow evolution within our bodies within days or hours. And this the immune system is designed to achieve. It contains a system for recombining different forms of proteins to increase their diversity and rapidly multiplying whichever antibody suddenly finds itself in action. Moreover, the genome includes a set of genes whose sole aim seems to be to maintain a huge diversity of forms: the major histocompatibility complex. The job of these 240 or so MHC genes is to present antigens from invading pathogens to the immune system so as to elicit an immune response. They are the most variable genes known, with one – HLA-B – coming in about 1,600 different versions in the human population. There is some evidence that many animals go to some lengths to maintain or enhance the variability further, by, for example, seeking out mates with different MHC genes (detected by smell).",The Evolution of Everything: How New Ideas Emerge,Matt Ridley,B00U1T9OSO,,yellow,,location,1375,2019-11-13 04:56:00+00:00

In the late 1970s a debate within Darwinism, between a predominantly American school led by the fossil expert Stephen Jay Gould and a predominantly British one led by the behaviour expert Richard Dawkins, about the pervasiveness of adaptation, led to some bitter and high-profile exchanges. Dawkins thought that almost every feature of a modern organism had probably been subject to selection for a function, whereas Gould thought that lots of change happened for accidental reasons. By the end, Gould seemed to have persuaded many lay people that Darwinism had gone too far; that it was claiming a fit between form and function too often and too glibly; that the idea of the organism adapting to its environment through natural selection had been refuted or at least diminished.

"Many of our political beliefs boil down to a vision of the person we hope to be. This is as true for the libertarian gun nut as it is the BLM pavement pounder. These visions are felt before they are thought, communicated better in pictures than paragraphs, the stuff of aspiration, not intellect. Keen intellects will rationalize their aesthetic aspirations post-hoc, of course, but those rationalizations are ancillary adornments to a deeper thing.

Was this not a the grand lessons of the 2010s? We learned it with the election of Hope and Change in 2008; we were reminded of it in the attacks on ""Pajama Boy"" and the triumph of the Tea Party; we were taught it again and again as internet battles played out between Tumblr warriors and the men of 8Chan; we see it on the streets of Hong Kong, in the fires of Paris, in triumphs of Trump and the travails of all who oppose him. We live in an age where politics has been swallowed whole by the aesthetic.

"The Soviet ideas were carried back to Paris by the French doctor (and communist) Fernand Lamaze, and humanised there – partly by bringing in birth partners, and less passive positions for labour, and more sophisticated techniques of auto-suggestion, but most of all by being made voluntary. A woman ‘doing Lamaze’ can aim for a birth with minimal medical intervention while knowing that the pethidine and the gas and the epidurals are there if she needs them.

"The Soviet economy did not move on from coal and steel and cement to plastics and microelectronics and software design, except in a very few military applications. It continued to compete with what capitalism had been doing in the 1930s, not with what it was doing now. It continued to suck resources and human labour in vast quantities into a heavy-industrial sector which had once been intended to exist as a springboard for something else, but which by now had become its own justification. Soviet industry in its last decades existed because it existed, an empire of inertia expanding ever more slowly, yet attaining the wretched distinction of absorbing more of the total effort of the economy that hosted it than heavy industry has ever done anywhere else in human history, before or since. Every year it produced goods that less and less corresponded to human needs, and whatever it once started producing, it tended to go on producing ad infinitum, since it possessed no effective stop signals except ruthless commands from above, and the people at the top no longer did ruthless, in the economic sphere. The control system for industry grew more and more erratic, the information flowing back to the planners grew more and more corrupt. And the activity of industry, all that human time and machine time it used up, added less and less value to the raw materials it sucked in. Maybe no value. Maybe less than none.

"‘The point being that it was incredibly hard for the stores to send the bad stuff back to the knitting mills, because it all counted towards their output targets. What we need is a planning system that counts the value of production rather the quantity. But that, in turn, requires prices which express the value of what’s produced.’ ‘The value to whom?’ ‘Good question,’ said Valentin. ‘Not just the value to the producer, or even to the consumer, because that only gives you capitalism again, surging to and fro, doing everything by trial and error. It’s got to be the value to the whole system; the amount it helps with what the whole economy is trying to do in the present plan period.

But –’ ‘– but –’ said Kostya, smiling. ‘– this is where the game theory comes in. That stuff about the many-person non-coalition game? It turns out that the mathematics is indifferent to whether the optimal level of production is organised hierarchically or happens in many distributed, autonomous units. So long as the prices generated by the algorithms are correct, all of the decisions can be made locally.

"For economics, after all, was a theory of everything. It wanted to explain the whole of human activity. The world was sweaty, the world was dusty, but it all made sense, because beneath the thousand thousand physical differences of things, economics saw one substance which mattered, perpetually being created and destroyed, being distributed, being poured from vessel to vessel, and in the process keeping the whole of human society in motion. It wasn’t money, this one common element shining through all its temporary disguises; money only expressed it. It wasn’t labour either, though labour created it. It was value. Value shone in material things once labour had made them useful, and then they could indeed be used or, since value gave the world a common denominator, exchanged for other useful things; which might look as dissimilar from one another as a trained elephant did from a cut diamond, and consequently as hard to compare, yet which, just then, contained equal value for their possessors, the proof being that they were willing to make the exchange.",Red Plenty,Francis Spufford (Goodreads Author),B0074HCLPE,"Labor Theory of Value, conseved as it moves from goos to good, as it is exchanged.",yellow,,location,1076,2019-12-17 04:56:00+00:00
"This was true the world over, in every kind of economy. But Marx had drawn a nightmare picture of what happened to human life under capitalism, when everything was produced only in order to be exchanged; when true qualities and uses dropped away, and the human power of making and doing itself became only an object to be traded. Then the makers and the things made turned alike into commodities, and the motion of society turned into a kind of zombie dance, a grim cavorting whirl in which objects and people blurred together till the objects were half alive and the people were half dead. Stock-market prices acted back upon the world as if they were independent powers, requiring factories to be opened or closed, real human beings to work or rest, hurry or dawdle; and they, having given the transfusion that made the stock prices come alive, felt their flesh go cold and impersonal on them, mere mechanisms for chunking out the man-hours. Living money and dying humans, metal as tender as skin and skin as hard as metal, taking hands, and dancing round, and round, and round, with no way ever of stopping; the quickened and the deadened, whirling on. That was Marx’s description, anyway. And what would be the alternative? The consciously arranged alternative? A dance of another nature, Emil presumed.

"“Does everybody work so hard, then?” Oiie’s wife asked. “What happens to a man who just won’t cooperate?” “Well, he moves on. The others get tired of him, you know. They make fun of him, or they get rough with him, beat him up; in a small community they might agree to take his name off the meals listing, so he has to cook and eat all by himself; that is humiliating.

"It was in Amoeno, a village a few miles from Ieu Eun, and it was by Urrasti standards a modest middle-class house, older than most, perhaps. It had been built about three hundred years ago, of stone, with wood-paneled rooms. The characteristic Ioti double arch was used in window frames and doorways. A relative absence of furniture pleased Shevek’s eye at once: the rooms looked austere, spacious, with their expanses of deeply polished floor. He had always felt uneasy amidst the extravagant decorations and conveniences of the public buildings in which the receptions, dedications, and so forth were held. The Urrasti had taste, but it seemed often to be in conflict with an impulse towards display—conspicuous expense. The natural, aesthetic origin of the desire to own things was concealed and perverted by economic and competitive compulsions, which in turn told on the quality of the things: all they achieved was a kind of mechanical lavishness.

Is there any direct path from Z to Y? Common sense says that there is no way that receiving a particular random number (Z) would affect cholesterol (Y), so the answer is no. Finally, is there a strong association between Z and X? This time the data themselves should be consulted, and the answer again is yes.

"In the last chapter, we looked at three rules that tell us how to stop the flow of information through any individual junction. I will repeat them for emphasis: (a) In a chain junction, A B C, controlling for B prevents information about A from getting to C or vice versa. (b) Likewise, in a fork or confounding junction, A B C, controlling for B prevents information about A from getting to C or vice versa. (c) Finally, in a collider, A B C, exactly the opposite rules hold. The variables A and C start out independent, so that information about A tells you nothing about C. But if you control for B, then information starts flowing through the “pipe,” due to the explain-away effect. We must also keep in mind another fundamental rule: (d) Controlling for descendants (or proxies) of a variable is like “partially” controlling for the variable itself. Controlling for a descendant of a mediator partly closes the pipe; controlling for a descendant of a collider partly opens the pipe. ... Finally, to deconfound two variables X and Y, we need only block every noncausal path between them without blocking or perturbing any causal paths. More precisely, a back-door path is any path from X to Y that starts with an arrow pointing into X. X and Y will be deconfounded if we block every back-door path (because such paths allow spurious correlation between X and Y). If we do this by controlling for some set of variables Z, we also need to make sure that no member of Z is a descendant of X on a causal path; otherwise we might partly or completely close off that path.",The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect,"Judea Pearl, Dana Mackenzie",B075CR9QBJ,,yellow,,location,2399,2019-01-16 04:56:00+00:00
"Robins and Greenland set out to express their conception of confounding in terms of potential outcomes. They partitioned the population into four types of individuals: doomed, causative, preventive, and immune. ... Ideally, each person would have a sticker on his forehead identifying which group he belonged to. Exchangeability simply means that the percentage of people with each kind of sticker (d percent, c percent, p percent, and i percent, respectively) should be the same in both the treatment and control groups. Equality among these proportions guarantees that the outcome would be just the same if we switched the treatments and controls. Otherwise, the treatment and control groups are not alike, and our estimate of the effect of the vaccine will be confounded. Note that the two groups may be different in many ways. They can differ in age, sex, health conditions, and a variety of other characteristics. Only equality among d, c, p, and i determines whether they are exchangeable or not. So exchangeability amounts to equality between two sets of four proportions, a vast reduction in complexity from the alternative of assessing the innumerable factors by which the two groups may differ. ... Using this commonsense definition of confounding, Greenland and Robins showed that the “statistical” definitions, both declarative and procedural, give incorrect answers. A variable can satisfy the three-part test of epidemiologists and still increase bias, if adjusted for.",The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect,"Judea Pearl, Dana Mackenzie",B075CR9QBJ,,yellow,,location,2366,2019-01-16 04:56:00+00:00
"Oddly, statisticians both over- and underrate the importance of adjusting for possible confounders. They overrate it in the sense that they often control for many more variables than they need to and even for variables that they should not control for. ... Statisticians have been immensely confused about what variables should and should not be controlled for, so the default practice has been to control for everything one can measure. The vast majority of studies conducted in this day and age subscribe to this practice. It is a convenient, simple procedure to follow, but it is both wasteful and ridden with errors. A key achievement of the Causal Revolution has been to bring an end to this confusion. At the same time, statisticians greatly underrate controlling in the sense that they are loath to talk about causality at all, even if the controlling has been done correctly. This too stands contrary to the message of this chapter: if you have identified a sufficient set of deconfounders in your diagram, gathered data on them, and properly adjusted for them, then you have every right to say that you have computed the causal effect X Y (provided, of course, that you can defend your causal diagram on scientific grounds).",The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect,"Judea Pearl, Dana Mackenzie",B075CR9QBJ,,yellow,,location,2105,2019-01-16 04:56:00+00:00
"The causal thinking that goes into the construction of the causal network will pay off, of course, in the type of questions the network can answer. Whereas a Bayesian network can only tell us how likely one event is, given that we observed another (rung-one information), causal diagrams can answer interventional and counterfactual questions. For example, the causal fork A B C tells us in no uncertain terms that wiggling A would have no effect on C, no matter how intense the wiggle. On the other hand, a Bayesian network is not equipped to handle a “wiggle,” or to tell the difference between seeing and doing, or indeed to distinguish a fork from a chain. In other words, both a chain and a fork would predict that observed changes in A are associated with changes in C, making no prediction about the effect of “wiggling” A.",The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect,"Judea Pearl, Dana Mackenzie",B075CR9QBJ,,yellow,,location,1994,2019-01-16 04:56:00+00:00

"This listening metaphor encapsulates the entire knowledge that a causal network conveys; the rest can be derived, sometimes by leveraging data. Note that if we reverse the order of arrows in the chain, thus obtaining A B C, the causal reading of the structure will change drastically, but the independence conditions will remain the same. The missing arrow between A and C will still mean that A and C are independent once we know the value of B, as in the original chain. This has two enormously important implications. First, it tells us that causal assumptions cannot be invented at our whim; they are subject to the scrutiny of data and can be falsified. For instance, if the observed data do not show A and C to be independent, conditional on B, then we can safely conclude that the chain model is incompatible with the data and needs to be discarded (or repaired). Second, the graphical properties of the diagram dictate which causal models can be distinguished by data and which will forever remain indistinguishable, no matter how large the data. For example, we cannot distinguish the fork A B C from the chain A B C by data alone because, with C listening to B only, the two imply the same independence conditions.",The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect,"Judea Pearl, Dana Mackenzie",B075CR9QBJ,,yellow,,location,1977,2019-01-16 04:56:00+00:00

"Why do I say that Monty Hall’s opening of Door 3 was a “transfer of information”? It didn’t, after all, provide any evidence about whether your initial choice of Door 1 was correct. You knew in advance that he was going to open a door that hid a goat, and so he did. No one should ask you to change your beliefs if you witness the inevitable. So how come your belief in Door 2 has gone up from one-third to two-thirds? The answer is that Monty could not open Door 1 after you chose it—but he could have opened Door 2. The fact that he did not makes it more likely that he opened Door 3 because he was forced to. Thus there is more evidence than before that the car is behind Door 2. This is a general theme of Bayesian analysis: any hypothesis that has survived some test that threatens its validity becomes more likely. The greater the threat, the more likely it becomes after surviving. Door 2 was vulnerable to refutation (i.e., Monty could have opened it), but Door 1 was not. Therefore, Door 2 becomes a more likely location, while Door 1 does not.

For example, the sales manager could develop a model of consumer behavior that includes market conditions. Even if she doesn’t have data on every factor, she might have data on enough key surrogates to make the prediction. A sufficiently strong and accurate causal model can allow us to use rung-one (observational) data to answer rung-two (interventional) queries. Without the causal model, we could not go from rung one to rung two.

If you know that you are at high risk for a disease to begin with, Bayes’s rule allows you to factor that information in. Or if you know that you are immune, you need not even bother with the test! In contrast, P(test | disease) does not depend on whether you are at high risk or not. It is “robust” to such variations, which explains to some degree why physicians organize their knowledge and communicate with forward probabilities. The former are properties of the disease itself, its stage of progression, or the sensitivity of the detecting instruments; hence they remain relatively invariant to the reasons for the disease (epidemic, diet, hygiene, socioeconomic status, family history).

"To connect Savage’s sure-thing principle to our previous discussion, suppose that the choice is actually between two properties, A and B. If the Democrat wins, the businessman has a 5 percent chance of making $1 on Property A and an 8 percent chance of making $1 on Property B. So B is preferred to A. If the Republican wins, he has a 30 percent chance of making $1 on Property A and a 40 percent chance of making $1 on Property B. Again, B is preferred to A. According to the sure-thing principle, he should definitely buy Property B. But sharp-eyed readers may notice that the numerical quantities are the same as in the Simpson story, and this may alert us that buying Property B may be too hasty a decision. In fact, the argument above has a glaring flaw. If the businessman’s decision to buy can change the election’s outcome (for example, if the media watched his actions), then buying Property A may be in his best interest.

If these contradict the data, then we have evidence that the relationships we assumed were false. This way of using path diagrams, rediscovered in 1953 by Herbert Simon (a 1978 Nobel laureate in economics), inspired much work in the social sciences.

If we disable that link in the chain, for instance by sucking all the smoke molecules away with a fume hood, then there will be no alarm.

"Note that the probability of necessity involves a contrast between two different worlds: the actual world where X = 1 and the counterfactual world where X = 0 (expressed by the subscript X = 0). In fact, hindsight (knowing what happened in the actual world) is a critical distinction between counterfactuals (rung three of the Ladder of Causation) and interventions (rung two). Without hindsight, there is no difference between P(YX = 0 = 0) and P(Y = 0 | do(X = 0)). Both express the probability that, under normal conditions, Judy will be alive if we ensure that the exit is not blocked; they do not mention the fire, Judy’s death, or the blocked exit. But hindsight may change our estimate of the probabilities. Suppose we observe that X = 1 and Y = 1 (hindsight). Then P(YX = 0 = 0 | X = 1, Y = 1) is not the same as P(YX = 0 = 0 | X = 1). Knowing that Judy died (Y = 1) gives us information on the circumstances that we would not get just by knowing that the door was blocked (X = 1). For one thing, it is evidence of the strength of the fire. In fact, it can be shown that there is no way to capture P(YX = 0 = 0 | X = 1, Y = 1) in a do-expression.

This diversity is the surest pledge of the complete development of production by mutual co-operation, and the moving cause of progress, while specialization is a hindrance to progress. Agriculture can only prosper in proximity to factories. And no sooner does a single factory appear than an infinite variety of other factories must spring up around, so that, mutually supporting and stimulating one another by their inventions, they increase their productivity.",The Conquest of Bread (The Kropotkin Collection Book 1),Peter Kropotkin,B074CJWR7X,,yellow,,location,2794,2019-09-27 04:56:00+00:00

"If every peasant-farmer had a piece of land, free from rent and taxes, if he had in addition the tools and the stock necessary for farm labour, who would plough the lands of the baron? Everyone would look after his own. But there are thousands of destitute persons ruined by wars, or drought, or pestilence. They have neither horse nor plough. (Iron was costly in the Middle Ages, and a draughthorse still more so.) All these destitute creatures are trying to better their condition. One day they see on the road at the confines of our baron’s estate a notice-board indicating by certain signs adapted to their comprehension that the labourer who is willing to settle on this estate will receive the tools and materials to build his cottage and sow his fields, and a portion of land rent free for a certain number of years. The number of years is represented by so many crosses on the sign-board, and the peasant understands the meaning of these crosses. So the poor wretches swarm over the baron’s lands, making roads, draining marshes, building villages. In nine years he begins to tax them. Five years later he increases the rent. Then he doubles it. The peasant accepts these new conditions because he cannot find better ones elsewhere; and little by little, with the aid of laws made by the barons, the poverty of the peasant becomes the source of the landlord’s wealth. And it is not only the lord of the manor who preys upon him. A whole host of usurers swoop down upon the villages, multiplying as the wretchedness of the peasants increases. That is how things went in the Middle Ages. And to-day is it not still the same thing? If there were free lands which the peasant could cultivate if he pleased, would he pay £50 to some “shabble of a duke” for condescending to sell him a scrap? Would he burden himself with a lease which absorbed a third of the produce? Would he — on the métayer system — consent to give the half of his harvest to the landowner? But he has nothing. So he will accept any conditions, if only he can keep body and soul together, while he tills the soil and enriches the landlord.

"However, there is one feature, common to all Socialist schemes, of the period, which must be noted. The three great founders of Socialism who wrote at the dawn of the nineteenth century were so entranced by the wide horizons which it opened before them, that they looked upon it as a new revelation, and upon themselves as upon the founders of a new religion. Socialism had to be a religion, and they had to regulate its march, as the heads of a new church. Besides, writing during the period of reaction which had followed the French Revolution, and seeing more its failures than its successes, they did not trust the masses, and they did not appeal to them for bringing about the changes which they thought necessary.

"How, then, shall we estimate the share of each in the riches which ALL contribute to amass? Looking at production from this general, synthetic point of view, we cannot hold with the Collectivists that payment proportionate to the hours of labour rendered by each would be an ideal arrangement, or even a step in the right direction. Without discussing whether exchange value of goods is really measured in existing societies by the amount of work necessary to produce it — according to the doctrine of Smith and Ricardo, in whose footsteps Marx has followed — suffice it to say here, leaving ourselves free to return to the subject later, that the Collectivist ideal appears to us untenable in a society which considers the instruments of labour as a common inheritance.

"One of the current objections to Communism and Socialism altogether, is that the idea is so old, and yet it could never be realized. Schemes of ideal States haunted the thinkers of Ancient Greece; later on, the early Christians joined in communist groups; centuries later, large communist brotherhoods came into existence during the Reform movement. Then, the same ideals were revived during the great English and French Revolutions; and finally, quite lately, in 1848, a revolution, inspired to a great extent with Socialist ideals, took place in France. “And yet, you see,” we are told, “how far away is still the realization of your schemes.

"Ultimately, it was a lesson in the principle of self-reliance, which my father insisted that America had forgotten sometime between his own childhood and mine. Ours was now a country in which the cost of replacing a broken machine with a newer model was typically lower than the cost of having it fixed by an expert, which itself was typically lower than the cost of sourcing the parts and figuring out how to fix it yourself. This fact alone virtually guaranteed technological tyranny, which was perpetuated not by the technology itself but by the ignorance of everyone who used it daily and yet failed to understand it. __To refuse to inform yourself about the basic operation and maintenance of the equipment you depended on was to passively accept that tyranny and agree to its terms: when your equipment works, you’ll work, but when your equipment breaks down you’ll break down, too.__ Your possessions would possess you.",Permanent Record,Edward Snowden,B07STQPGH6,,yellow,favorite,location,402,2019-10-18 04:56:00+00:00

"You can think of TURMOIL as a guard positioned at an invisible firewall through which Internet traffic must pass. Seeing your request, it checks its metadata for selectors, or criteria, that mark it as deserving of more scrutiny. Those selectors can be whatever the NSA chooses, whatever the NSA finds suspicious: a particular email address, credit card, or phone number; the geographic origin or destination of your Internet activity; or just certain keywords such as “anonymous Internet proxy” or “protest.” If TURMOIL flags your traffic as suspicious, it tips it over to TURBINE, which diverts your request to the NSA’s servers. There, algorithms decide which of the agency’s exploits—malware programs—to use against you. This choice is based on the type of website you’re trying to visit as much as on your computer’s software and Internet connection. These chosen exploits are sent back to TURBINE (by programs of the QUANTUM suite, if you’re wondering), which injects them into the traffic channel and delivers them to you along with whatever website you requested.

The data we generate just by living—or just by letting ourselves be surveilled while living—would enrich private enterprise and impoverish our private existence in equal measure.

In retrospect, my country could have done so much with this opportunity. It could have treated terror not as the theological phenomenon it purported to be, but as the crime it was. It could have used this rare moment of solidarity to reinforce democratic values and cultivate resilience in the now-connected global public. Instead, it went to war. The greatest regret of my life is my reflexive, unquestioning support for that decision. I was outraged, yes, but that was only the beginning of a process in which my heart completely defeated my rational judgment. I accepted all the claims retailed by the media as facts, and I repeated them as if I were being paid for it. I wanted to be a liberator. I wanted to free the oppressed. I embraced the truth constructed for the good of the state, which in my passion I confused with the good of the country. It was as if whatever individual politics I’d developed had crashed—the anti-institutional hacker ethos instilled in me online, and the apolitical patriotism I’d inherited from my parents, both wiped from my system—and I’d been rebooted as a willing vehicle of vengeance.

After having spent roughly half that period as an employee of the American Intelligence Community and roughly the other half in exile, I know better than most how often the agencies get things wrong.

"You could hate a sofa, of course—that is, if you could hate a sofa. But it didn’t matter. You still had to get together $4.80 a month. If you had to pay $4.80 a month for a sofa that started off split, no good, and humiliating—you couldn’t take any joy in owning it. And the joylessness stank, pervading everything. The stink of it kept you from painting the beaverboard walls; from getting a matching piece of material for the chair; even from sewing up the split, which became a gash, which became a gaping chasm that exposed the cheap frame and cheaper upholstery. It withheld the refreshment in a sleep slept on it. It imposed a furtiveness on the loving done on it. Like a sore tooth that is not content to throb in isolation, but must diffuse its own pain to other parts of the body—making breathing difficult, vision limited, nerves unsettled, so a hated piece of furniture produces a fretful malaise that asserts itself throughout the house and limits the delight of things not related to it.",The Bluest Eye (Vintage International),Toni Morrison,B000TWUTYQ,,yellow,,location,509,2019-08-14 04:56:00+00:00
"The second building block of Collier book is based on his interpretation of Adam Smith, which has become more popular recently and tries to “soften” the hard edge of the Adam Smith of the “Wealth of Nations” (self-interest, profit, and power) by a more congenial Smith from “The Theory of Moral Sentiments”. This is an old debate that goes almost 200 years back (“Die Adam Smith Frage”).

There are, I think, if not two Smiths, then one Smith for two sets of circumstances: in TMS, it is the Smith for our behavior with family, friends and community; in the WoN, it is the Smith of economic life, our behavior as “economic agents”. I discuss this in “Capitalism, Alone”. David Wootton in ""Power, Pleasure and Profit"" very persuasively makes the same point. And even Collier says exactly the same thing on page 174, towards the end of his book, but in the early parts he argues that the Adam Smith of TMS applies to economics as well.",Nostalgia for a past that never was; Part 1 review of Paul Collier’s “The future of capitalism”,glineq.blogspot.com,,,,,order,1,2019-08-16 11:18:47+00:00
"A cynical observer might conclude that this is all just revolution as usual—a small clique of agitators seizing more and more power, and purging their enemies by virtue of their superior internal solidarity, a bold and demanding ideology, lukewarm popular moral support, and no real organized opposition. In some ways, that is what’s going on. They have the bold ideology, the ambient support, and no real opposition.

But importantly, they don’t have internal coordination by any means other than adherence to the ideology itself. Even members of the clique are never really safe. Anyone who contradicts the latest consensus version of the constantly mutating ideology, even if they have worked to its benefit or are otherwise obviously on side, gets purged. If you don’t keep up, you get purged.

It doesn’t matter that the ideology is abusive to its own constituents and allies, or that it doesn’t really even serve its formal beneficiaries. All that matters is this: for everyone who gets purged for a slight infraction, there are dozens who learn from this example never to stand up to the ideology, dozens who learn that they can attack with impunity if they use the ideology to do it, and dozens who are vaguely convinced by its rhetoric to be supportive of the next purge. So, on it goes.

This is the nature of coordination via ideology. If you’re organizing out of some common interest, you can have lively debates about what to do, how things work, who’s right and wrong, and even core aspects of your intellectual paradigm. But if your only standard for membership in your power coalition is detailed adherence to your ideology, as is increasingly true for membership in elite circles, then it becomes very hard to correct mistakes, or switch to a different paradigm.

And this helps explain much of the quagmire American elites are stuck in: being unable to speak outside of the current ideology, the only choice is to double down on a failing paradigm. These failures lead to lower elite morale, resulting in the class identity crisis which afflicts so many at Yale. Ironically, the result is an expression of that ideology which is increasingly rigid on ever more minute points of belief and conduct.",The Real Problem At Yale Is Not Free Speech,palladiummag.com,,,,,order,1,2019-08-15 16:17:22+00:00
"Unfortunately it is nowadays the fashion to pretend that the glass is penetrable. Of course everyone knows that class-prejudice exists, but at the same time everyone claims that he, in some mysterious way, is exempt from it. Snobbishness is one of those vices which we can discern in everyone else but never in ourselves. Not only the croyant et pratiquant Socialist, but every “intellectual” takes it as a matter of course that he at least is outside the class-racket; he, unlike his neighbours, can see through the absurdity of wealth, ranks, titles, etc., etc. “I’m not a snob” is nowadays a kind of universal credo.",The Road to Wigan Pier,George Orwell,B004H1UECM,,yellow,,location,2006,2018-06-17 04:56:00+00:00

"But those years, during and just after the war, were a queer time to be at school, for England was nearer revolution than she has been since or had been for a century earlier. Throughout almost the whole nation there was running a wave of revolutionary feeling which has since been reversed and forgotten, but which has left various deposits of sediment behind. Essentially, though of course one could not then see it in perspective, it was a revolt of youth against age, resulting directly from the war. In the war the young had been sacrificed and the old had behaved in a way which, even at this distance of time, is horrible to contemplate; they had been sternly patriotic in safe places while their sons went down like swathes of hay before the German machine guns. Moreover, the war had been conducted mainly by old men and had been conducted with supreme incompetence. By 1918 everyone under forty was in a bad temper with his elders, and the mood of anti-militarism which followed naturally upon the fighting was extended into a general revolt against orthodoxy and authority. At that time there was, among the young, a curious cult of hatred of “old men.” The dominance of “old men” was held to be responsible for every evil known to humanity, and every accepted institution from Scott’s novels to the House of Lords was derided merely because “old men” were in favour of it.",The Road to Wigan Pier,George Orwell,B004H1UECM,,yellow,,location,1783,2018-06-17 04:56:00+00:00
"Watching coal-miners at work, you realise momentarily what different universes different people inhabit. Down there where coal is dug it is a sort of world apart which one can quite easily go through life without ever hearing about. Probably a majority of people would even prefer not to hear about it. Yet it is the absolutely necessary counterpart of our world above. Practically everything we do, from eating an ice to crossing the Atlantic, and from baking a loaf to writing a novel, involves the use of coal, directly or indirectly. For all the arts of peace coal is needed; if war breaks out it is needed all the more. In time of revolution the miner must go on working or the revolution must stop, for revolution as much as reaction needs coal.",The Road to Wigan Pier,George Orwell,B004H1UECM,,yellow,,location,535,2018-06-17 04:56:00+00:00
"Curiously enough it is not the triumphs of modern engineering, nor the radio, nor the cinematograph, nor the five thousand novels which are published yearly, nor the crowds at Ascot and the Eton and Harrow match, but the memory of working-class interiors—especially as I sometimes saw them in my childhood before the war, when England was still prosperous—that reminds me that our age has not been altogether a bad one to live in.",The Road to Wigan Pier,George Orwell,B004H1UECM,,yellow,,location,1569,2018-06-17 04:56:00+00:00
"And all the while everyone who uses his brain knows that Socialism, as a world-system and wholeheartedly applied, is a way out. It would at least ensure our getting enough to eat even if it deprived us of everything else. Indeed, from one point of view, Socialism is such elementary common sense that I am sometimes amazed that it has not established itself already. The world is a raft sailing through space with, potentially, plenty of provisions for everybody; the idea that we must all co-operate and see to it that everyone does his fair share of the work and gets his fair share of the provisions, seems so blatantly obvious that one would say that no one could possibly fail to accept it unless he had some corrupt motive for clinging to the present system.",The Road to Wigan Pier,George Orwell,B004H1UECM,,pink,pink,location,2176,2018-06-17 04:56:00+00:00
"The people are in effect living a reduced version of their former lives. Instead of raging against their destiny they have made things tolerable by lowering their standards.

"For several years it was all the fashion to be a “Bolshie,” as people then called it. England was full of half-baked antinomian opinions. Pacifism, internationalism, humanitarianism of all kinds, feminism, free love, divorce-reform, atheism, birth-control—things like these were getting a better hearing than they would get in normal times. And of course the revolutionary mood extended to those who had been too young to fight, even to public schoolboys. At that time we all thought of ourselves as enlightened creatures of a new age, casting off the orthodoxy that had been forced upon us by those detested “old men.” We retained, basically, the snobbish outlook of our class, we took it for granted that we should continue to draw our dividends or tumble into soft jobs, but also it seemed natural to us to be “agin the government.”",The Road to Wigan Pier,George Orwell,B004H1UECM,,yellow,,location,1792,2018-06-17 04:56:00+00:00
"Two incidents stick in my mind as examples of the queer revolutionary feeling of that time. One day the master who taught us English set us a kind of general knowledge paper of which one of the questions was, “Whom do you consider the ten greatest men now living?” Of sixteen boys in the class (our average age was about seventeen) fifteen included Lenin in their list. This was at a snobbish expensive public school, and the date was 1920, when the horrors of the Russian Revolution were still fresh in everyone’s mind. Also there were the so-called peace celebrations in 1919. Our elders had decided for us that we should celebrate peace in the traditional manner by whooping over the fallen foe. We were to march into the school-yard, carrying torches, and sing jingo songs of the type of “Rule Britannia.” The boys—to their honour, I think—guyed the whole proceeding and sang blasphemous and seditious words to the tunes provided…",The Road to Wigan Pier,George Orwell,B004H1UECM,,yellow,,location,1799,2018-06-17 04:56:00+00:00
"The Coles, Webbs, Stracheys, etc., are not exactly proletarian writers. It is doubtful whether anything describable as proletarian literature now exists—even the Daily Worker is written in standard South English—but a good music-hall comedian comes nearer to producing it than any Socialist writer I can think of. As for the technical jargon of the Communists, it is as far removed from the common speech as the language of a mathematical textbook. I remember hearing a professional Communist speaker address a working-class audience. His speech was the usual bookish stuff, full of long sentences and parentheses and “Notwithstanding” and “Be that as it may,” besides the usual jargon of “ideology” and “class-consciousness” and “proletarian solidarity” and all the rest of it. After him a Lancashire working man got up and spoke to the crowd in their own broad lingo. There was not much doubt which of the two was nearer to his audience, but I do not suppose for a moment that the Lancashire working man was an orthodox Communist.",The Road to Wigan Pier,George Orwell,B004H1UECM,,yellow,,location,2235,2018-06-17 04:56:00+00:00
"The fact that has got to be faced is that to abolish class-distinctions means abolishing a part of yourself. Here am I, a typical member of the middle class. It is easy for me to say that I want to get rid of class-distinctions, but nearly everything I think and do is a result of class-distinctions. All my notions—notions of good and evil, of pleasant and unpleasant, of funny and serious, of ugly and beautiful—are essentially middle-class notions; my taste in books and food and clothes, my sense of honour, my table manners, my turns of speech, my accent, even the characteristic movements of my body, are the products of a special kind of upbringing and a special niche about half-way up the social hierarchy. When I grasp this I grasp that it is no use clapping a proletarian on the back and telling him that he is as good a man as I am; if I want real contact with him, I have got to make an effort for which very likely I am unprepared. For to get outside the class-racket I have got to suppress not merely my private snobbishness, but most of my other tastes and prejudices as well. I have got to alter myself so completely that at the end I should hardly be recognisable as the same person. What is involved is not merely the amelioration of working-class conditions, nor an avoidance of the more stupid forms of snobbery, but a complete abandonment of the upper-class and middle-class attitude to life. And whether I say Yes or No probably depends upon the extent to which I grasp what is demanded of me.",The Road to Wigan Pier,George Orwell,B004H1UECM,,yellow,,location,2060,2018-06-17 04:56:00+00:00
"Hence, at the age of seventeen or eighteen, I was both a snob and a revolutionary. I was against all authority. I had read and re-read the entire published works of Shaw, Wells, and Galsworthy (at that time still regarded as dangerously “advanced” writers), and I loosely described myself as a Socialist. But I had not much grasp of what Socialism meant, and no notion that the working class were human beings. At a distance, and through the medium of books—Jack London’s The People of the Abyss, for instance—I could agonise over their sufferings, but I still…",The Road to Wigan Pier,George Orwell,B004H1UECM,,yellow,,location,1807,2018-06-17 04:56:00+00:00
"That was what we were taught—the lower classes smell. And here, obviously, you are at an impassable barrier. For no feeling of like or dislike is quite so fundamental as a physical feeling. Race-hatred, religious hatred, differences of education, of temperament, of intellect, even differences of moral code, can be got over; but physical repulsion cannot. You can have an affection for a murderer or a sodomite, but you cannot have an affection for a man whose breath stinks—habitually stinks, I mean. However well you may wish him, however much you may admire his mind and character, if his breath stinks he is horrible and in your heart of hearts you will hate him. It may not greatly matter if the average middle-class person is brought up to believe that the working classes are ignorant, lazy, drunken, boorish and dishonest; it is when he is brought up to believe that they are dirty that the harm is done. And in my childhood we were brought up to believe that they were dirty. Very early in life you acquired the idea that there was something subtly repulsive about a working-class body; you would not get nearer to it than you could help. You watched a great sweaty navvy walking down the road with his pick over his shoulder; you looked at his discoloured shirt and his corduroy trousers stiff with the dirt of a decade; you thought of those nests and layers of greasy rags below, and, under all, the unwashed body, brown all over (that was how I used to imagine it), with its strong, bacon-like reek. You watched a tramp taking off his boots in a ditch—ugh! It did not seriously occur to you that the tramp might not enjoy having black feet. And even “lower-class” people whom you knew to be quite clean—servants, for instance—were faintly unappetising. The smell of their sweat, the very texture of their skins, were mysteriously different from yours.",The Road to Wigan Pier,George Orwell,B004H1UECM,,yellow,,location,1660,2018-06-17 04:56:00+00:00
"As we moved slowly through the outskirts of the town we passed row after row of little grey slum houses running at right angles to the embankment. At the back of one of the houses a young woman was kneeling on the stones, poking a stick up the leaden waste-pipe which ran from the sink inside and which I suppose was blocked. I had time to see everything about her—her sacking apron, her clumsy clogs, her arms reddened by the cold. She looked up as the train passed, and I was almost near enough to catch her eye. She had a round pale face, the usual exhausted face of the slum girl who is twenty-five and looks forty, thanks to miscarriages and drudgery; and it wore, for the second in which I saw it, the most desolate, hopeless expression I have ever seen. It struck me then that we are mistaken when we say that “It isn’t the same for them as it would be for us,” and that people bred in the slums can imagine nothing but the slums. For what I saw in her face was not the ignorant suffering of an animal. She knew well enough what was happening to her—understood as well as I did how dreadful a destiny it was to be kneeling there in the bitter cold, on the slimy stones of a slum backyard, poking a stick up a foul drain-pipe.",The Road to Wigan Pier,George Orwell,B004H1UECM,,yellow,,location,356,2018-06-17 04:56:00+00:00

"That is the attitude of the typical left-winger towards imperialism, and a thoroughly flabby, boneless attitude it is. For in the last resort, the only important question is, Do you want the British Empire to hold together or do you want it to disintegrate? And at the bottom of his heart no Englishman, least of all the kind of person who is witty about Anglo-Indian colonels, does want it to disintegrate. For, apart from any other consideration, the high standard of life we enjoy in England depends upon our keeping a tight hold on the Empire, particularly the tropical portions of it such as India and Africa. Under the capitalist system, in order that England may live in comparative comfort, a hundred million Indians must live on the verge of starvation—an evil state of affairs, but you acquiesce in it every time you step into a taxi or eat a plate of strawberries and cream. The alternative is to throw the Empire overboard and reduce England to a cold and unimportant little island where we should all have to work very hard and live mainly on herrings and potatoes. That is the very last thing that any left-winger wants. Yet the left-winger continues to feel that he has no moral responsibility for imperialism.

"A few years ago this might have seemed unimportant. It seems only yesterday that Socialists, especially orthodox Marxists, were telling me with superior smiles that Socialism was going to arrive of its own accord by some mysterious process called “historic necessity.” Possibly that belief still lingers, but it has been shaken, to say the least of it. Hence the sudden attempts of Communists in various countries to ally themselves with democratic forces which they have been sabotaging for years past. At a moment like this it is desperately necessary to discover just why Socialism has failed in its appeal. And it is no use writing off the current distaste for Socialism as the product of stupidity or corrupt motives. If you want to remove that distaste you have got to understand it, which means getting inside the mind of the ordinary objector to Socialism, or at least regarding his viewpoint sympathetically. No case is really answered until it has had a fair hearing.

"The fact is that Socialism, in the form in which it is now presented, appeals chiefly to unsatisfactory or even inhuman types. On the one hand you have the warm-hearted unthinking Socialist, the typical working-class Socialist, who only wants to abolish poverty and does not always grasp what this implies. On the other hand, you have the intellectual, book-trained Socialist, who understands that it is necessary to throw our present civilisation down the sink and is quite willing to do so. And this type is drawn, to begin with, entirely from the middle class, and from a rootless town-bred section of the middle class at that. Still more unfortunately, it includes—so much so that to an outsider it even appears to be composed of—the kind of people I have been discussing; the foaming denouncers of the bourgeoisie, and the more-water-in-your-beer reformers of whom Shaw is the prototype, and the astute young social-literary climbers who are Communists now, as they will be Fascists five years hence, because it is all the go, and all that dreary tribe of high-minded women and sandal-wearers and bearded fruit-juice drinkers who come flocking towards the smell of “progress” like bluebottles to a dead cat. The ordinary decent person, who is in sympathy with the essential aims of Socialism, is given the impression that there is no room for his kind in any Socialist party that means business. Worse, he is driven to the cynical conclusion that Socialism is a kind of doom which is probably coming but must be staved off as long as possible. Of course, as I have suggested already, it is not strictly fair to judge a movement by its adherents; but the point is that people invariably do so, and that the popular conception of Socialism is coloured by the conception of a Socialist as a dull or disagreeable person. “Socialism” is pictured as a state of affairs in which our more vocal Socialists would feel thoroughly at home. This does great harm to the cause. The ordinary man may not flinch from a dictatorship of the proletariat, if you offer it tactfully; offer him a dictatorship of the prigs, and he gets ready to fight.",The Road to Wigan Pier,George Orwell,B004H1UECM,,yellow,,location,2319,2018-06-17 04:56:00+00:00
"And this tradition of open hostility between upper and lower class had apparently been the same for at least a century past.

Let’s frighten ’is ’oss!” Just fancy the street boys trying to frighten his horse now! They would be much likelier to hang round him in vague hopes of a tip. During the past dozen years the English working class have grown servile with a rather horrifying rapidity. It was bound to happen, for the frightful weapon of unemployment has cowed them. Before the war their economic position was comparatively strong, for though there was no dole to fall back upon, there was not much unemployment, and the power of the boss class was not so obvious as it is now.

"The first thing that must strike any outside observer is that Socialism in its developed form is a theory confined entirely to the middle class. The typical Socialist is not, as tremulous old ladies imagine, a ferocious-looking working man with greasy overalls and a raucous voice. He is either a youthful snob-Bolshevik who in five years’ time will quite probably have made a wealthy marriage and been converted to Roman Catholicism; or, still more typically, a prim little man with a white-collar job, usually a secret teetotaller and often with vegetarian leanings, with a history of Nonconformity behind him, and, above all, with a social position which he has no intention of forfeiting. This last type is surprisingly common in Socialist parties of every shade; it has perhaps been taken over en bloc from the old Liberal Party.

"Here I shall be accused of being behind the times, for I was a child before and during the war and it may be claimed that children nowadays are brought up with more enlightened notions. It is probably true that class-feeling is for the moment a very little less bitter than it was. The working class are submissive where they used to be openly hostile, and the post-war manufacture of cheap clothes and the general softening of manners have toned down the surface differences between class and class. But undoubtedly the essential feeling is still there. Every middle-class person has a dormant class-prejudice which needs only a small thing to arouse it; and if he is over forty he probably has a firm conviction that his own class has been sacrificed to the class below. Suggest to the average unthinking person of gentle birth who is struggling to keep up appearances on four or five hundred a year that he is a member of an exploiting parasite class, and he will think you are mad. In perfect sincerity he will point out to you a dozen ways in which he is worse-off than a working man. In his eyes the workers are not a submerged race of slaves, they are a sinister flood creeping upwards to engulf himself and his friends and his family and to sweep all culture and all decency out of existence.

"The most dreadful thing about people like the Brookers is the way they say the same things over and over again. It gives you the feeling that they are not real people at all, but a kind of ghost for ever rehearsing the same futile rigmarole. In the end Mrs. Brooker’s self-pitying talk—always the same complaints, over and over, and always ending with the tremulous whine of “It does seem ’ard, don’t it now?”—revolted me even more than her habit of wiping her mouth with bits of newspaper. But it is no use saying that people like the Brookers are just disgusting and trying to put them out of mind. For they exist in tens and hundreds of thousands; they are one of the characteristic by-products of the modern world. You cannot disregard them if you accept the civilisation that produced them. For this is part at least of what industrialism has done for us. Columbus sailed the Atlantic, the first steam engines tottered into motion, the British squares stood firm under the French guns at Waterloo, the one-eyed scoundrels of the nineteenth century praised God and filled their pockets; and this is where it all led—to labyrinthine slums and dark back kitchens with sickly, ageing people creeping round and round them like blackbeetles.

"Every novelist of serious pretensions adopts an ironic attitude towards his upper-class characters. Indeed when a novelist has to put a definitely upper-class person—a duke or a baronet or whatnot—into one of his stories he guys him more or less instinctively. There is an important subsidiary cause of this in the poverty of the modern upper-class dialect.

"As to the particular question of the Soviet Union, the insistence of Socialists on the achievements of Soviet industrialisation arises from the fact that the most frequent argument which Socialists have to face is precisely this: “I agree with you that Socialism would be wholly admirable if it would work—but it wouldn’t.” Somewhere or other Mr. Orwell speaks of intelligent and unintelligent Socialists, and brushes aside people who say “it wouldn’t work” as belonging to the latter category. My own experience is that this is still the major sincere objection to Socialism on the part of decent people, and the major insincere objection on the part of indecent people who in fact are thinking of their dividends. It is true that the objection was more frequently heard in 1919 than in 1927, in 1927 than at the end of the first Five Year Plan, and at the end of the first Five Year Plan than to-day—the reason being precisely that quite so direct a non possumus hardly carries conviction, when the achievements of the Soviet Union are there for everyone to see. But people will go on hypnotising themselves and others with a formula, even when that formula is patently outworn: so that it is still necessary, and will be necessary for a long time yet, to show that modern methods of production do work under Socialism and no longer work under capitalism.",The Road to Wigan Pier,George Orwell,B004H1UECM,,pink,pink,location,143,2018-06-17 04:56:00+00:00
"But when you come to the normal working class the position is totally different. To begin with, there is no short cut into their midst. You can become a tramp simply by putting on the right clothes and going to the nearest casual ward, but you can’t become a navvy or a coal-miner. You couldn’t get a job as a navvy or a coal-miner even if you were equal to the work. Via Socialist politics you can get in touch with the working-class intelligentsia, but they are hardly more typical than tramps or burglars. For the rest you can only mingle with the working class by staying in their houses as a lodger, which always has a dangerous resemblance to “slumming.” For some months I lived entirely in coal-miners’ houses. I ate my meals with the family, I washed at the kitchen sink, I shared bedrooms with miners, drank beer with them, played darts with them, talked to them by the hour together. But though I was among them, and I hope and trust they did not find me a nuisance, I was not one of them, and they knew it even better than I did. However much you like them, however interesting you find their conversation, there is always that accursed itch of class-difference, like the pea under the princess’s mattress. It is not a question of dislike or distaste, only of difference, but it is enough to make real intimacy impossible. Even with miners who described themselves as Communists I found that it needed tactful manoeuvrings to prevent them from calling me “sir”; and all of them, except in moments of great animation, softened their northern accents for my benefit. I liked them and hoped they liked me; but I went among them as a foreigner, and both of us were aware of it. Which ever way you turn this curse of class-difference confronts you like a wall of stone. Or rather it is not so much like a stone wall as the plate-glass pane of an aquarium; it is so easy to pretend that it isn’t there, and so impossible to get through it.",The Road to Wigan Pier,George Orwell,B004H1UECM,,yellow,,location,1992,2018-06-17 04:56:00+00:00
"Meanwhile one can observe on every side that dreary phenomenon, the middle-class person who is an ardent Socialist at twenty-five and a sniffish Conservative at thirty-five. In a way his recoil is natural enough—at any rate, one can see how his thoughts run. Perhaps a classless society doesn’t mean a beatific state of affairs in which we shall all go on behaving exactly as before except that there will be no class-hatred and no snobbishness; perhaps it means a bleak world in which all our ideals, our codes, our tastes—our “ideology,” in fact will have no meaning. Perhaps this class-breaking business isn’t so simple as it looked! On the contrary, it is a wild ride into the darkness, and it may be that at the end of it the smile will be on the face of the tiger. With loving though slightly patronising smiles we set out to greet our proletarian brothers, and behold! our proletarian brothers—in so far as we understand them—are not asking for our greetings, they are asking us to commit suicide . . .

"It may be said, however, that even if the theoretical book-trained Socialist is not a working man himself, at least he is actuated by a love of the working class. He is endeavouring to shed his bourgeois status and fight on the side of the proletariat—that, obviously, must be his motive. But is it? Sometimes I look at a Socialist—the intellectual, tract-writing type of Socialist, with his pullover, his fuzzy hair, and his Marxian quotation—and wonder what the devil his motive really is. It is often difficult to believe that it is a love of anybody, especially of the working class, from whom he is of all people the furthest removed. The underlying motive of many Socialists, I believe, is simply a hypertrophied sense of order. The present state of affairs offends them not because it causes misery, still less because it makes freedom impossible, but because it is untidy; what they desire, basically, is to reduce the world to something resembling a chessboard.",The Road to Wigan Pier,George Orwell,B004H1UECM,,yellow,,location,2274,2018-06-17 04:56:00+00:00
"More than anyone else, perhaps, the miner can stand as the type of the manual worker, not only because his work is so exaggeratedly awful, but also because it is so vitally necessary and yet so remote from our experience, so invisible, as it were, that we are capable of forgetting it as we forget the blood in our veins. In a way it is even humiliating to watch coal-miners working. It raises in you a momentary doubt about your own status as an “intellectual” and a superior person generally. For it is brought home to you, at least while you are watching, that it is only because miners sweat their guts out that superior persons can remain superior. You and I and the editor of the Times Lit. Supp., and the Nancy poets and the Archbishop of Canterbury and Comrade X, author of Marxism for Infants—all of us really owe the comparative decency of our lives to poor drudges underground, blackened to the eyes, with their throats full of coal dust, driving their shovels forward with arms and belly muscles of steel.",The Road to Wigan Pier,George Orwell,B004H1UECM,,yellow,,location,555,2018-06-17 04:56:00+00:00

Some of these objections may appear frivolous or self-contradictory, but that is beside the point; I am merely discussing symptoms. Anything is relevant which helps to make clear why Socialism is not accepted. And please notice that I am arguing for Socialism, not against it. But for the moment I am advocatus diaboli. I am making out a case for the sort of person who is in sympathy with the fundamental aims of Socialism, who has the brains to see that Socialism would “work,” but who in practice always takes to flight when Socialism is mentioned. Question a person of this type, and you will often get the semi-frivolous answer: “I don’t object to Socialism, but I do object to Socialists.” Logically it is a poor argument, but it carries weight with many people.

"This scene is still reduplicated in a majority of English homes, though not in so many as before the war. Its happiness depends mainly upon one question—whether Father is in work. But notice that the picture I have called up, of a working-class family sitting round the coal fire after kippers and strong tea, belongs only to our own moment of time and could not belong either to the future or the past. Skip forward two hundred years into the Utopian future, and the scene is totally different. Hardly one of the things I have imagined will still be there. In that age when there is no manual labour and everyone is “educated,” it is hardly likely that Father will still be a rough man with enlarged hands who likes to sit in shirt-sleeves and says “Ah wur coomin’ oop street.” And there won’t be a coal fire in the grate, only some kind of invisible heater. The furniture will be made of rubber, glass and steel. If there are still such things as evening papers there will certainly be no racing news in them, for gambling will be meaningless in a world where there is no poverty and the horse will have vanished from the face of the earth. Dogs, too, will have been suppressed on grounds of hygiene. And there won’t be so many children, either, if the birth-controllers have their way. But move backwards into the Middle Ages and you are in a world almost equally foreign.

"But on the whole we are not aware of it; we all know that we “must have coal,” but we seldom or never remember what coal-getting involves. Here am I, sitting writing in front of my comfortable coal fire. It is April but I still need a fire. Once a fortnight the coal cart drives up to the door and men in leather jerkins carry the coal indoors in stout sacks smelling of tar and shoot it clanking into the coal-hole under the stairs. It is only very rarely, when I make a definite mental effort, that I connect this coal with that far-off labour in the mines. It is just “coal”—something that I have got to have; black stuff that arrives mysteriously from nowhere in particular, like manna except that you have to pay for it. You could quite easily drive a car right across the north of England and never once remember that hundreds of feet below the road you are on the miners are hacking at the coal.

"Poverty and, what is more, the habits of mind created by poverty, are something to be abolished from above, by violence if necessary; perhaps even preferably by violence. Hence his worship of “ great” men and appetite for dictatorships, Fascist or Communist; for to him, apparently (vide his remarks apropos of the Italo-Abyssinian war and the Stalin-Wells conversations), Stalin and Mussolini are almost equivalent persons. You get the same thing in a more mealy-mouthed form in Mrs. Sidney Webb’s autobiography, which gives, unconsciously, a most revealing picture of the high-minded Socialist slum-visitor. The truth is that to many people, calling themselves Socialists, revolution does not mean a movement of the masses with which they hope to associate themselves; it means a set of reforms which “we,” the clever ones, are going to impose upon “them,” the Lower Orders. On. the other hand, it would be a mistake to regard the book-trained Socialist as a bloodless creature entirely incapable of emotion. Though seldom giving much evidence of affection for the exploited, he is perfectly capable of displaying hatred—a sort of queer, theoretical, in vacuo hatred—against the exploiters. Hence the grand old Socialist sport of denouncing the bourgeoisie.

"What the Socialist who has advanced beyond the most elementary stage says (and I really mean what he says, not what he ought to say) is that capitalist industrialism is a certain stage which we have reached in the business of providing for our needs, comforts and luxuries: that though it may be amusing to speculate on whether or not a pre-industrialist civilisation might be a more attractive one in which to live, it is a matter of plain common sense that, whatever individuals may wish, industrialism will go on: that (if Mr. Orwell will forgive the jargon) such “contradictions” have developed in the machine of capitalist industrialism that the thing is visibly breaking down: that such break-down means poverty, unemployment and war: and that the only solution is the supersession of anarchic capitalist industrialism by planned Socialist industrialism.",The Road to Wigan Pier,George Orwell,B004H1UECM,,pink,pink,location,132,2018-06-17 04:56:00+00:00
"For it must be remembered that a working man, so long as he remains a genuine working man, is seldom or never a Socialist in the complete, logically consistent sense. Very likely he votes Labour, or even Communist if he gets the chance, but his conception of Socialism is quite different from that of the book-trained Socialist higher up. To the ordinary working man, the sort you would meet in any pub on Saturday night, Socialism does not mean much more than better wages and shorter hours and nobody bossing you about. To the more revolutionary type, the type who is a hunger-marcher and is blacklisted by employers, the word is a sort of rallying-cry against the forces of oppression, a vague threat of future violence. But, so far as my experience goes, no genuine working man grasps the deeper implications of Socialism. Often, in my opinion, he is a truer Socialist than the orthodox Marxist, because he does remember, what the other so often forgets, that Socialism means justice and common decency. But what he does not grasp is that Socialism cannot be narrowed down to mere economic justice and that a reform of that magnitude is bound to work immense changes in our civilisation and his own way of life.

"Would it not be better if they spent more money on wholesome things like oranges and wholemeal bread or if they even, like the writer of the letter to the New Statesman, saved on fuel and ate their carrots raw? Yes, it would, but the point is that no ordinary human being is ever going to do such a thing. The ordinary human being would sooner starve than live on brown bread and raw carrots. And the peculiar evil is this, that the less money you have, the less inclined you feel to spend it on wholesome food. A millionaire may enjoy breakfasting off orange juice and Ryvita biscuits; an unemployed man doesn’t. Here the tendency of which I spoke at the end of the last chapter comes into play.

"A middle-class person embraces Socialism and perhaps even joins the Communist Party. How much real difference does it make? Obviously, living within the framework of capitalist society, he has got to go on earning his living, and one cannot blame him if he clings to his bourgeois economic status. But is there any change in his tastes, his habits, his manners, his imaginative background—his “ideology,” in Communist jargon? Is there any change in him except that he now votes Labour, or, when possible. Communist at the elections? It is noticeable that he still habitually associates with his own class; he is vastly more at home with a member of his own class, who thinks him a dangerous Bolshie, than with a member of the working class who supposedly agrees with him; his tastes in food, wine, clothes, books, pictures, music, ballet, are still recognisably bourgeois tastes; most significant of all, he invariably marries into his own class. Look at any bourgeois Socialist. Look at Comrade X, member of the C.P.G.B. and author of Marxism for Infants. Comrade X, it so happens, is an old Etonian. He would be ready to die on the barricades, in theory anyway, but you notice that he still leaves his bottom waistcoat button undone. He idealises the proletariat, but it is remarkable how little his habits resemble theirs. Perhaps once, out of sheer bravado, he has smoked a cigar with the band on, but it would be almost physically impossible for him to put pieces of cheese into his mouth on the point of his knife, or to sit indoors with his cap on, or even to drink his tea put of the saucer. Perhaps table-manners are not a bad test of sincerity. I have known numbers of bourgeois Socialists, I have listened by the hour to their tirades against their own class, and yet never, not even once, have I met one who had picked up proletarian table-manners. Yet, after all, why not? Why should a man who thinks all virtue resides in the proletariat still take such pains to drink his soup silently? It can only be because in his heart he feels that proletarian manners are disgusting.

"If you want a good illustration of this, it is worth studying the novels and plays of John Galsworthy, keeping one eye on their chronology. Galsworthy is a very fine specimen of the thin-skinned, tear-in-the-eye, pre-war humanitarian. He starts out with a morbid pity-complex which extends even to thinking that every married woman is an angel chained to a satyr. He is in a perpetual quiver of indignation over the sufferings of overworked clerks, of under-paid farm hands, of fallen women, of criminals, of prostitutes, of animals. The world, as he sees it in his earlier books (The Man of Property, Justice, etc.), is divided into oppressors and oppressed, with the oppressors sitting on top like some monstrous stone idol which all the dynamite in the world cannot overthrow. But is it so certain that he really wants it overthrown? On the contrary, in his fight against an immovable tyranny he is upheld by the consciousness that it is immovable.

"Trade since the war has had to adjust itself to meet the demands of underpaid, underfed people, with the result that a luxury is nowadays almost always cheaper than a necessity. One pair of plain solid shoes costs as much as two ultra-smart pairs. For the price of one square meal you can get two pounds of cheap sweets. You can’t get much meat for threepence, but you can get a lot of fish-and-chips. Milk costs threepence a pint and even “mild” beer costs fourpence, but aspirins are seven a penny and you can wring forty cups of tea out of a quarter-pound packet. And above all there is gambling, the cheapest of all luxuries. Even people on the verge of starvation can buy a few days’ hope (“Something to live for,” as they call it) by having a penny on a sweepstake. Organised gambling has now risen almost to the status of a major industry. Consider, for instance, a phenomenon like the Football Pools, with a turnover of about six million pounds a year, almost all of it from the pockets of working-class people. I happened to be in Yorkshire when Hitler re-occupied the Rhineland. Hitler, Locarno, Fascism and the threat of war aroused hardly a flicker of interest locally, but the decision of the Football Association to stop publishing their fixtures in advance (this was an attempt to quell the Football Pools) flung all Yorkshire into a storm of fury. And then there is the queer spectacle of modern electrical science showering miracles upon people with empty bellies. You may shiver all night for lack of bedclothes, but in the morning you can go to the public library and read the news that has been telegraphed for your benefit from San Francisco and Singapore.

"Hence, if in any process there are a number of contradictions, one of them must be the principal contradiction playing the leading and decisive role, while the rest occupy a secondary and subordinate position. Therefore, in studying any complex process in which there are two or more contradictions, we must devote every effort to funding its principal contradiction. Once this principal contradiction is grasped, all problems can be readily solved. This is the method Marx taught us in his study of capitalist society. Likewise Lenin and Stalin taught us this method when they studied imperialism and the general crisis of capitalism and when they studied the Soviet economy.

"As can be seen from the articles written by Soviet philosophers criticizing it, the Deborin school maintains that contradiction appears not at the inception of a process but only when it has developed to a certain stage. If this were the case, then the cause of the development of the process before that stage would be external and not internal. Deborin thus reverts to the metaphysical theories of external causality and of mechanism. Applying this view in the analysis of concrete problems, the Deborin school sees only differences but not contradictions between the kulaks and the peasants in general under existing conditions in the Soviet Union, thus entirely agreeing with Bukharin. In analysing the French Revolution, it holds that before the Revolution there were likewise only differences but not contradictions within the Third Estate, which was composed of the workers, the peasants and the bourgeoisie.

"Would things be even better if the political power too was in the hands of capitalists? This is doubtful. They might have used it to recreate the Nanjing government of the 1930s, venal, weak and incompetent. They would not work hard but would use political power to maintain their economic privileges. It is one of the key problems of US capitalism today that the rich increasingly control the political process and thus skew economic incentives away from production and competition into creation and preservation of monopolies. Much worse would likely have happened in China. It is precisely because the political sphere was largely insulated from the economic sphere that capitalists could be safely kept busy with production, and at arm’s length (as far as possible because the party is exposed to growing corruption) from the politics.",globalinequality: Hayekian communism,glineq.blogspot.com,,,,,order,1,2018-11-13 17:17:23+00:00

In this he has succeeded amazingly, and his conscious striving will have its most lasting effect only so far as, with or without his knowledge, it contributes to this result.

For, as we have seen, we have never been able to choose our morals. Though there is a tendency to interpret goodness in a utilitarian way, to claim that ‘good’ is what brings about desired results, this claim is neither true nor useful.

"A pertinent example is the way transitive verbs ascribe to inanimate objects some sort of mind-like action. Just as the naive or untutored mind tends to assume the presence of life wherever it perceives movement, it also tends to assume the activity of mind or spirit wherever it imagines that there is purpose. The situation is aggravated by the fact that, to some degree, the evolution of the human race seems to repeat itself during the early development of each human mind. In his account of The Child’s Conception of the World (1929:359), Jean Piaget writes: ‘The child begins by seeing purpose everywhere.’ Only secondarily is the mind concerned with differentiating between purposes of the things themselves (animism) and purposes of the makers of the things (artificialism).",The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism (The Collected Works of F.

"It was Rousseau who – declaring in the opening statement of The Social Contract that ‘man was born free, and he is everywhere in chains’, and wanting to free men from all ‘artificial’ restraints – made what had been called the savage the virtual hero of progressive intellectuals, urged people to shake off the very restraints to which they owed their productivity and numbers, and produced a conception of liberty that became the greatest obstacle to its attainment. After asserting that animal instinct was a better guide to orderly cooperation among men than either tradition or reason, Rousseau invented the fictitious will of the people, or ‘general will’, through which the people ‘becomes one single being, one individual’ (Social Contract, I, vii; and see Popper, 1945/1966:II, 54). This is perhaps the chief source of the fatal conceit of modern intellectual rationalism that promises to lead us back to a paradise wherein our natural instincts rather than learnt restraints upon them will enable us ‘to subdue the world’, as we are instructed in the book of Genesis.",The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism (The Collected Works of F.

"Much of the ‘alienation’ or unhappiness of modern life stems from two sources, one of which affects primarily intellectuals, the other, all beneficiaries of material abundance. The first is a self-fulfilling prophecy of unhappiness for those within any ‘system’ that does not satisfy rationalistic criteria of conscious control. Thus intellectuals from Rousseau to such recent figures in French and German thought as Foucault and Habermas regard alienation as rampant in any system in which an order is ‘imposed’ on individuals without their conscious consent; consequently, their followers tend to find civilisation unbearable – by definition, as it were. Secondly, the persistence of instinctual feelings of altruism and solidarity subject those who follow the impersonal rules of the extended order to what is now fashionably called ‘bad conscience’; similarly, the acquisition of material success is supposed to be attended with feelings of guilt (or ‘social conscience’). In the midst of plenty, then, there is unhappiness not only born of peripheral poverty, but also of the incompatibility, on the part of instinct and of a hubristic reason, with an order that is of a decidedly non-instinctive and extra-rational character.",The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism (The Collected Works of F.

Such demands, particularly in Einstein’s mouth, seemed so superficially plausible that even a sensible philosopher, twitting Einstein for talking beyond his competence in some of his popular writings, stated approvingly that ‘Einstein is clearly aware that the present economic crisis is due to our system of production for profit rather than for use, to the fact that our tremendous increase of productive power is not actually followed by a corresponding increase in the purchasing power of the great masses’ (M.

To refer to terms now used in biological discussion, cultural evolution simulates Lamarckism (Popper, 1972). Moreover, cultural evolution is brought about through transmission of habits and information not merely from the individual’s physical parents, but from an indefinite number of ‘ancestors’. The processes furthering the transmission and spreading of cultural properties by learning also, as already noted, make cultural evolution incomparably faster than biological evolution. Finally, cultural evolution operates largely through group selection; whether group selection also operates in biological evolution remains an open question – one on which my argument does not depend",The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism (The Collected Works of F.

Yet his painstaking efforts to illustrate how the process of evolution operated in living organisms convinced the scientific community of what had long been a commonplace in the humanities – at least since Sir William Jones in 1787 recognised the striking resemblance of Latin and Greek to Sanskrit, and the descent of all ‘Indo-Germanic’ languages from the latter.

"Though the book raises in this way some difficult scientific and philosophical questions, its chief task remains to demonstrate that one of the most influential political movements of our time, socialism, is based on demonstrably false premises, and despite being inspired by good intentions and led by some of the most intelligent representatives of our time, endangers the standard of living and the life itself of a large proportion of our existing population. This is argued in the fourth through sixth chapters, wherein I examine and refute the socialist challenge to the account of the development and maintenance of our civilisation that I offer in the first three chapters.

"All this confirms that the feelings that press against the restraints of civilisation are anachronistic, adapted to the size and conditions of groups in the distant past. Moreover, if civilisation has resulted from unwanted gradual changes in morality, then, reluctant as we may be to accept this, no universally valid system of ethics can ever be known to us. It would however be wrong to conclude, strictly from such evolutionary premises, that whatever rules have evolved are always or necessarily conducive to the survival and increase of the populations following them. We need to show, with the help of economic analysis (see chapter five), how rules that emerge spontaneously tend to promote human survival. Recognising that rules generally tend to be selected, via competition, on the basis of their human survival-value certainly does not protect those rules from critical scrutiny.

If we were to apply the unmodified, uncurbed, rules of the micro-cosmos (i.e., of the small band or troop, or of, say, our families) to the macro-cosmos (our wider civilisation), as our instincts and sentimental yearnings often make us wish to do, we would destroy it. Yet if we were always to apply the rules of the extended order to our more intimate groupings, we would crush them. So we must learn to live in two sorts of world at once.

"Yet the lasting benefits of some instincts should not be overlooked, including the particular endowment that enabled some other instinctual modes to be at least partly displaced. For example, by the time culture began to displace some innate modes of behaviour, genetic evolution had probably also already endowed human individuals with a great variety of characteristics which were better adjusted to the many different environmental niches into which men had penetrated than those of any non-domesticated animal – and this was probably so even before growing division of labour within groups provided new chances of survival for special types.

I shall consider some of these analogies and differences below, but we might mention here that biological evolution would have been far too slow to alter or replace man’s innate responses in the course of the ten or twenty thousand years during which civilisation has developed – not to speak of being too slow to have influenced the far greater numbers whose ancestors joined the process only a few hundred years ago.

"What distinguishes good from bad in learned discourse, then, is not the adoption of a particular methodology, __but the earnest and intelligent attempt to contribute to a conversation.__ This is the oldest of philosophical doctrines. Plato was, as Cicero said, the best orator when making merry of orators, and his Socrates was the first and best conversationalist from the pen of a man trying to end conversation. The best modern statement is Michael Oakeshott's: 'As civilized human beings, we are the inheritors, neither of an inquiry about ourselves and the world, nor of an accumulating body of information, __but of a conversation begun in the primeval forest and extended and made more articulate in the course of centuries. Education, properly speaking, is an initiation ... in which we acquire the intellectual and moral habits appropriate to conversation__"" (1933, pp. 198-99).",The Rhetoric of Economics (Rhetoric of the Human Sciences),Deirdre N.

"Most economists believe that once you have reduced a question to numbers you have taken it out of human hands. That's where the rhetoric of quantification goes crazily wrong.The best quantitative economists know it. The rhetorical point is idiotically simple. It is that in a human conversation a number is high or low relative only to some standard, and the only relevant standard is provided by the humans involved. ... The question ""But how large is large?"" applies to any quantitative argument. It gets some of its excellence from its father in thought, the terrifying, mind-stunning ""So what?"" and from its Jewish mother, ""So what else is new?""

"Real proofs ""are established by 'consensus of the qualified""' and are ""not checkable ... by any mathematician not privy to the gestalt, the mode of thought in the particular field. It may take generations to detect an error"" (p. 354; cf. Davis and Hersh 1987). Compare again Cardinal Newman's, A Grammar of Assent (1870): ""Strange as it may seem, this contrast between inference [that is, formal demonstration] and assent is exemplified even in the province of mathematics. Argument is not always able to command our assent, even though demonstrative. I am not speaking of short and lucid demonstrations; but of long and intricate mathematical investigations"" (ch. 6, sec. 1, item 6). Newman, who had studied mathematics at Oxford, was in a position to know-admitting that in 1816 mathematics had not yet embarked on the program of rigor that climaxed in Hilbert's school.At the end of the Hilbertian experiment, Davis and Hersh assert,The actual experience of all schools-and the actual daily experience of mathematicians-shows that mathematical truth, like other kinds of truth, is fallible and corrigible. It is reasonable to propose a different task for mathematical philosophy, not to seek indubitable truth, but to give an account of mathematical knowledge as it really is-fallible, corrigible, tentative, and evolving, as is every other kind of human knowledge.

"thinking about thinking that suits antimodernism is rhetoric. Rhetoric is not a new methodology. It is antimethodology. It points out what we actually do, what seems to persuade us, and why. At the end of his treatment of the rhetoric of analytic philosophy Stanley Rosen declared that his argumentis not offered as a new theory or how to philosophize, but as an account of what we actually do. The positive task of the philosopher is to fecundate his analytic skills with dreams, and to discipline his dreams with analysis. I cannot provide him with a manual of rules and regulations governing this activity. There are no rules and regulations for being reasonable, and certainly no rules and regulations for dreaming reasonable dreams. (1980, p. 260)To repeat: ""There are no rules and regulations for being reasonable."" Being reasonable is weighing and considering all reasons, not merelythe reasons that some methodology or epistemology or logic claims to be stations of the cross along the one path to Justified True Belief. A methodology that claims the historical dialectic or the hypotheticode- ductive model or phenomenology or historical t'erstehen or any one style of giving reasons to be The One is probably unreasonable. The reasonable rhetorician cannot write down his rules. They are numberless, because they cover all reasons, and bromidic, because they cover all circumstances. Above all, they change.

"Saussure's famous example of the 8:25 express from Geneva to Paris makes the point (p. 108). He observed that the 8:25 is for purposes of travel the same train every day, even though it is never the same in physical makeup. The cars, the personnel, even the exact time of departure, may vary (the last not very much in the Switzerland of Saussure's day), and of course a car a day older is not the same car it was. Yet the train is the same, defined by its opposition to other trains and its uses in the mental worlds of its passengers. In like fashion, economics is oriented away from such matters as the exact makeup of pairings in the marketplace or the origin of a particular product. It will not digest ideas of embodied labor, the history of institutions, the dependence of a particular demander on a particular supplier, or anything else along the axis of successions.It keeps trying, and keeps failing. Economics has seen various projects to make the subject dynamic, to bring it into real time, to give it an historical perspective, to find out how much labor power is embodied in surplus value, to make it, in a word, diachronic. The comparison with synchronic linguistics suggests why the projects have failed to deflect economics from its static purity. Marxism, the German Historical School, Institutionalism new and old, have been trying to graft diachronic limbs onto a synchronic tree. The limbs keep falling off, to grow and flourish perhaps by themselves, but not as offshoots of the tree of analysis descended from Mandeville and Smith.",The Rhetoric of Economics (Rhetoric of the Human Sciences),Deirdre N.

"Only a few economists appreciate the narrowness of what tests of significance can do. Edward Learner argued in ""Let's Take the Con Out of Econometrics"" (1983) that the specification error from omitting an important variable-and what student of society imagines she has kept in mind every important variable?-leaves a term in the expression for the sample covariance that does not go to zero as the sample size increases. The term does not change at all, because it is not caused by sampling error; it is caused (as I just said) by specification error. The precision of the statistical estimates therefore does not increase much with a larger sample. The methods of statistics deal, quite properly, with sampling errors alone, and cannot be expected to help with others. When these others are serious, as we all believe they usually are, there is no point in continuing to talk relatively much about the (relatively small) sampling error. To do so, as economists and other quantifiers do nowadays on a massive scale, is to imitate the drunk who looks for his keys under the lamp post because the light is better there. Learner's solution to the problem will please historians, anthropologists, geologists, and other scholars who have more patience with facts than economists have. Go back into the dark and look for other kinds of evidence, not more evidence of the same kind (the sampling problem oversolved again), but evidence of different kinds, whose biases are distributed independently of the biases in the first kind. Including these will cut the error in half. Including a third kind will cut it to a third.",The Rhetoric of Economics (Rhetoric of the Human Sciences),Deirdre N.

"In an essay called 'Anti-Anti-Relativism"" Clifford Geertz has argued that the fear that chaos will come from abandoning rigid methodologies is unreasonable: ""There may be some genuine nihilists out there, along Rodeo Drive or around Times Square,"" he says, ""but I doubt very many have become such as a result of an excessive sensitivity to theclaims of other cultures. Anti-relativism has largely concocted the anxiety it lives from"" (1984). And Richard Rorty says the same in his essay ""Relativism"" (1984a). All of these literary and social scientific and philosophic people are making the same point, an obvious one by now but apparently still worth making: be of good cheer, for it is real politics, not professors' politics, that leads to chaos, or to the revolution.An irrational fear that Western intellectual life is about to be overrun by nihilists grips many people. It amounts to a reaction to the 1960s among people like Daniel Bell, who are unaware or unimpressed that the 1960s actually did liberate women and gays and blacks and others. They are driven by their fear to the advocate Objectivity, Demarcation, and other regimens said to be good for toughening, such as birching and dips in the river on New Year's Day. They were not always so devoted to the strenuous life. The Second World War and the Cold War helped do it. American historians in the 1940s and early 1950s, for instance, forswore their faith in relativism and took up an icy if unexamined Objectivity (Novick 1988). It was a premeditated act of ideology. The war against fascist and communist dictatorships, they as much as said, would be won or lost in the seminar room.The point is that these political arguments against an openly rhetorical history or biology or economics are notably weak and unargued. The alternative to blindered methodologies of modernism is not a mob warring against itself but a body of enlightened thinkers engaging in earnest conversation in which they know what rhetorics they use. Perhaps the thinkers would be more enlightened and more earnest when freed to make arguments that actually bore on the scientific questions at issue.",The Rhetoric of Economics (Rhetoric of the Human Sciences),Deirdre N.

"The social character of scientific knowledge does not make it arbitrary, touchie-feelie, mob-governed, or anything else likely to bring it into disrepute. It is still, for instance, ""objective,"" if that is a worry. In vulgar usage the objective/subjective distinction beloved of Western philosophy since Descartes means discussable/undiscussable. But even in a sophisticated sense ""objectivity"" has a necessarily social definition: we know that the yield of corn in the Middle Ages was objectively lowbecause we converse with people who agree with our evidence and our calculations and our standard of comparison validating the word ""low.""Nor are such human standards peculiar to the human sciences. The mathematician Armand Borel notes that ""something becomes objective ... as soon as we are persuaded that it exists in the minds of others in the same form that it does in ours, and that we can think about it and discuss it together"" (1983, p. 13). A scale of particle durations, star sizes, or electrical activity of the brain depends on being able to ""discuss it together.""

"The humanist's approach is wrong. It falls for demarcation, supposing without thinking about it much that science is easily demarcated from nonscience. Anyway, economics surely is science, a pretty successful sort at that, though with some peculiar problems coming from its rhetorical naivete. Economics explains as much about business people and resources as evolution explains about animals and plants, for identical reasons. No one who knows the subject will deny it. Those who do not know it can become persuaded by reading Mancur Olson's Logic of Collective Action (1965) or Thomas Schelling's Micromotives and Macro-behavior (1978) or Albert Hirschman's Exit, Voice, and Loyalty (1970) or Robert Frank's Passions Within Reason (1988) or another of the accessiblejewels of the discipline.

"style appeals in various ways to an ethos worthy of belief. For example, a test claiming authority uses the ""gnomic present,"" as in the sentence you are reading now, or in the Bible, or repeatedly in the historian David Landes's well-known book on modern economic growth, The Unbound Prometheus (1969). Thus in one paragraph on p. 562, ""large-scale, mechanized manufacture requires not only machines and buildings ... but ... social capital.... These are costly, because the investment required is lumpy.... The return on such investment is often long deferred."" Only the last sentences of the paragraph connect the rest to the narrative past: ""the burden has tended to grow.""The advantage of the gnomic present is its claim to the authority of General Truth, which is another of its names in grammar.

"The difference between the two audiences created by the author seems less decisive in economic science than in explicit fiction, probably because we all know that bears do not talk but we do not all know that the notion of ""marginal productivity"" in economics is a metaphor. The narrative audience in science, as in ""Goldilocks,"" is fooled by the fiction, which is as it should be. But in science the authorial audience is fooled, too (and, incidentally, so is part of the literal audience, the actual readers as against the ideal readers the author seems to want to have). Michael Mulkay, again, has shown how important the inadvertent choice of authorial audience is in the scholarly correspondence of biochemists. Biochemists like other scientists and scholars are largely unaware of their literary devices, and become puzzled and angry when their literal audience refuses to believe in talking bears (Mulkay 1985, ch. 2). They think they are merely stating facts, not making audiences. Small wonder that scientists and scholars disagree, even when their rhetoric of ""what the facts say"" would seem to make disagreement impossible.Science requires more resources of the language than raw sense data and first-order predicate logic.It requires what may be called the Rhetorical Tetrad (McCloskey 1994, pp. 61-63). Fact and logic also come into the economics in large doses. Economics is a science, and a jolly good one, too.

"The best way to think of the Alt-Right conception of race is to compare human populations to dog breeds. There are certainly many Yorkshire terriers that aren’t yappy, and it was a Labrador retriever that actually bit the Dog Whisperer. But anyone who knows the slightest thing about dogs would regard these as aberrations—and that includes dog breeders themselves. In other words, it is precisely the people who have the most knowledge and experience with a given breed that will be the first to explain that there are certain behavioral tendencies that can be expected. Humans aren’t dogs, of course. Well, dogs aren’t dogs per se either: A French bulldog in Berlin doesn’t become a German shepherd. A Yorkie is a Yorkie in Ireland, and a Welsh corgi can tend cattle in Scotland just as well. It’s easy to argue that an immigrant who is culturally Muslim or Jewish or Christian would gladly adopt liberal Western values while maintaining their faith at home and recognizing the rights of others to do the same. It happens all the time. Yet the Alt-Right claim is that not only does this not happen enough, but it can’t.

"Farage’s life work came to pass when he forced the UK to have a referendum on leaving the EU, and then led that referendum to victory against pretty much the entire British establishment. There were several reasons why so many on the American New Right were such enthusiastic cheerleaders of Brexit. The first and most obvious was that it was a clear reclamation of national sovereignty from an international organization. It was the British people asserting themselves as British and not as Europeans, stating in not so many words that country comes before continent and that not all countries are equal or equally good. Second, it was partly a repudiation of the concept of free movement and free migration. The Schengen Agreement allows people to travel throughout Europe without stopping at national borders. This is taken advantage of in northern Africa, where migrants jump fences to land on what is technically European soil and then make their way to continental Europe. Any chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Reclaiming one’s borders is seen as an urgently necessary prerequisite for maintaining one’s culture and preventing things like Islam (and its minority component of radical Islam) from setting up roots.",The New Right: A Journey to the Fringe of American Politics,Michael Malice,B07HF2JM5L,,yellow,,location,2409,2019-06-13 04:56:00+00:00

Virtually all the Founding Fathers, including George Washington himself, were still alive when the Fifth Congress passed the Sedition Act, signed into law by John Adams. The act made it a federal crime to criticize the government or the president, leading to the arrest and imprisonment of several journalists.

The Democrats took an unrelated bill that had a majority, deleted the entire text, and inserted the text for Obamacare instead. Then, they passed the entirety through reconciliation, which does not require a filibuster-proof majority but is explicitly meant to be used exclusively for budgetary issues, not legislation.

"The Pinochet parable almost reads like a folk tale (volk tale?). In 1970, “socialist” Salvador Allende was elected Chile’s president. Allende was a “mere” socialist in the same sense that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, north Korea, is “democratic”: i.e., not at all. Allende was a totalitarian Marxist, the likes of which would be seen in Venezuela in President Hugo Chavez decades later. The usual communist tactics ensued, including the seizure of private property and the killing of those who opposed such actions. A free press was swiftly becoming a thing of the past, and legalized crime via the state became the norm. Tens of thousands of foreign operatives infiltrated Chile to ensure the revolution was carried through to completion. The Supreme Court ruled against Allende’s legitimacy, and the people took to the streets. Things were getting worse and worse. In an attempt to restore order to Chile, Pinochet and the military staged a coup in 1973. Allende died during the conflict, either by his own hand or that of his men’s. Pinochet’s men ended up killing over three thousand people as they seized power. These three thousand deaths are at the heart of the argument against Pinochet.",The New Right: A Journey to the Fringe of American Politics,Michael Malice,B07HF2JM5L,Is this story true?

"The New Right holds to the idea that aspiring to the literally impossible (i.e., pure democracy) is insane, dangerous, and almost inevitably counterproductive. Democracy should thus be regarded not as an ideal but as a bait-and-switch used by the left to foster their own elite—one that is allegedly in the service of everyone. It is one of the left’s myriad excuses to claim for themselves the right to set the agenda, to recognize who can speak, and to frame the questions of the day. As Michels further claims, it is inevitable that the more “democratic” a party or nation claims to be, the more rigid the hierarchy becomes in practice. It’s no coincidence that the official name of north Korea is the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. But even if oligarchy is inevitable, social change still occurs. The French Revolution was more democratic than the monarchy. The federal government was different from the Articles of Confederation, which were in turn a departure from the period when what became the United States were thirteen British colonies. Here is where we come to Vilfredo Pareto. Pareto argued that the way societies move is via the circulation of elites. Every society has some elite (or ruling class) or another. Access to the elite might be more open or closed. In an aristocracy, where admission to the elite is via birth, it is largely closed.

"I then labeled each row with the dates of the week and taped it to the wall next to my computer monitor (where it couldn’t be ignored). As each week progressed, I kept track of the hours spent in deep work that week with a simple tally of tick marks in that week’s row. To maximize the motivation generated by this scoreboard, whenever I reached an important milestone in an academic paper (e.g., solving a key proof), I would circle the tally mark corresponding to the hour where I finished the result.* This served two purposes. First, it allowed me to connect, at a visceral level, accumulated deep work hours and tangible results.

"The implication is that once you’ve hit your deep work limit in a given day, you’ll experience diminishing rewards if you try to cram in more. Shallow work, therefore, doesn’t become dangerous until after you add enough to begin to crowd out your bounded deep efforts for the day. At first, this caveat might seem optimistic. The typical workday is eight hours. The most adept deep thinker cannot spend more than four of these hours in a state of true depth. It follows that you can safely spend half the day wallowing in the shallows without adverse effect. The danger missed by this analysis is how easily this amount of time can be consumed, especially once you consider the impact of meetings, appointments, calls, and other scheduled events. For many jobs, these time drains can leave you with surprisingly little time left for solo work.",Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World,Cal Newport,B00X47ZVXM,,yellow,,location,2434,2019-02-02 04:56:00+00:00

"At the beginning of each workday, turn to a new page of lined paper in a notebook you dedicate to this purpose. Down the left-hand side of the page, mark every other line with an hour of the day, covering the full set of hours you typically work. Now comes the important part: Divide the hours of your workday into blocks and assign activities to the blocks. For example, you might block off nine a.m. to eleven a.m. for writing a client’s press release. To do so, actually draw a box that covers the lines corresponding to these hours, then write “press release” inside the box. Not every block need be dedicated to a work task. There might be time blocks for lunch or relaxation breaks. To keep things reasonably clean, the minimum length of a block should be thirty minutes (i.e., one line on your page). This means, for example, that instead of having a unique small box for each small task on your plate for the day—respond to boss’s e-mail, submit reimbursement form, ask Carl about report—you can batch similar things into more generic task blocks. You might find it useful, in this case, to draw a line from a task block to the open right-hand side of the page where you can list out the full set of small tasks you plan to accomplish in that block.",Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World,Cal Newport,B00X47ZVXM,,yellow,,location,2468,2019-02-02 04:56:00+00:00
"Part of what fueled social media’s rapid assent, I contend, is its ability to short-circuit this connection between the hard work of producing real value and the positive reward of having people pay attention to you. It has instead replaced this timeless capitalist exchange with a shallow collectivist alternative: I’ll pay attention to what you say if you pay attention to what I say—regardless of its value. A blog or magazine or television program that contained the content that typically populates a Facebook wall or Twitter feed, for example, would attract, on average, no audience. But when captured within the social conventions of these services, that same content will attract attention in the form of likes and comments. The implicit agreement motivating this behavior is that in return for receiving (for the most part, undeserved) attention from your friends and followers, you’ll return the favor by lavishing (similarly undeserved) attention on them. You “like” my status update and I’ll “like” yours.

"“Take the case of a Londoner who works in an office, whose office hours are from ten to six, and who spends fifty minutes morning and night in travelling between his house door and his office door,” Bennett writes in his 1910 self-help classic, How to Live on 24 Hours a Day. This hypothetical London salaryman, he notes, has a little more than sixteen hours left in the day beyond these work-related hours. To Bennett, this is a lot of time, but most people in this situation tragically don’t realize its potential. The “great and profound mistake which my typical man makes in regard to his day,” he elaborates, is that even though he doesn’t particularly enjoy his work (seeing it as something to “get through”), “he persists in looking upon those hours from ten to six as ‘the day,’ to which the ten hours preceding them and the six hours following them are nothing but a prologue and epilogue.” This is an attitude that Bennett condemns as “utterly illogical and unhealthy.” What’s the alternative to this state of affairs? Bennett suggests that his typical man see his sixteen free hours as a “day within a day,” explaining, “during those sixteen hours he is free; he is not a wage-earner; he is not preoccupied with monetary cares; he is just as good as a man with a private income.” Accordingly, the typical man should instead use this time as an aristocrat would: to perform rigorous self-improvement—a task that, according to Bennett, involves, primarily, reading great literature and poetry.",Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World,Cal Newport,B00X47ZVXM,,yellow,,location,2324,2019-02-02 04:56:00+00:00

Try this experiment no more than once a week at first—giving your brain practice with intensity, but also giving it (and your stress levels) time to rest in between. Once you feel confident in your ability to trade concentration for completion time, increase the frequency of these Roosevelt dashes.

"To simplify matters, when scheduling Internet use after work, you can allow time-sensitive communication into your offline blocks (e.g., texting with a friend to agree on where you’ll meet for dinner), as well as time-sensitive information retrieval (e.g., looking up the location of the restaurant on your phone). Outside of these pragmatic exceptions, however, when in an offline block, put your phone away, ignore texts, and refrain from Internet usage. As in the workplace variation of this strategy, if the Internet plays a large and important role in your evening entertainment, that’s fine: Schedule lots of long Internet blocks. The key here isn’t to avoid or even to reduce the total amount of time you spend engaging in distracting behavior, but is instead to give yourself plenty of opportunities throughout your evening to resist switching to these distractions at the slightest hint of boredom.",Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World,Cal Newport,B00X47ZVXM,,yellow,,location,1823,2019-02-02 04:56:00+00:00
"It’s crucial in this situation, therefore, that you don’t immediately abandon an offline block, even when stuck. If it’s possible, switch to another offline activity for the remainder of the current block (or perhaps even fill in this time relaxing). If this is infeasible—perhaps you need to get the current offline activity done promptly—then the correct response is to change your schedule so that your next Internet block begins sooner. The key in making this change, however, is to not schedule the next Internet block to occur immediately. Instead, enforce at least a five-minute gap between the current moment and the next time you can go online. This gap is minor, so it won’t excessively impede your progress, but from a behavioralist perspective, it’s substantial because it separates the sensation of wanting to go online from the reward of actually doing so.",Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World,Cal Newport,B00X47ZVXM,,yellow,favorite,location,1813,2019-02-02 04:56:00+00:00

"Another key commitment for succeeding with this strategy is to support your commitment to shutting down with a strict shutdown ritual that you use at the end of the workday to maximize the probability that you succeed. In more detail, this ritual should ensure that every incomplete task, goal, or project has been reviewed and that for each you have confirmed that either (1) you have a plan you trust for its completion, or (2) it’s captured in a place where it will be revisited when the time is right. The process should be an algorithm: a series of steps you always conduct, one after another. When you’re done, have a set phrase you say that indicates completion (to end my own ritual, I say, “Shutdown complete”). This final step sounds cheesy, but it provides a simple cue to your mind that it’s safe to release work-related thoughts for the rest of the day. To make this suggestion more concrete, let me walk through the steps of my own shutdown ritual (which I first developed around the time I was writing my doctoral dissertation, and have deployed, in one form or another, ever since). The first thing I do is take a final look at my e-mail inbox to ensure that there’s nothing requiring an urgent response before the day ends. The next thing I do is transfer any new tasks that are on my mind or were scribbled down earlier in the day into my official task lists. (I use Google Docs for storing my task lists, as I like the ability to access them from any computer—but the technology here isn’t really relevant.) Once I have these task lists open, I quickly skim every task in every list, and then look at the next few days on my calendar. These two actions ensure that there’s nothing urgent I’m forgetting or any important deadlines or appointments sneaking up on me. I have, at this point, reviewed everything that’s on my professional plate. To end the ritual, I use this information to make a rough plan for the next day. Once the plan is created, I say, “Shutdown complete,” and my work thoughts are done for the day. The concept of a shutdown ritual might at first seem extreme, but there’s a good reason for it: the Zeigarnik effect. This effect, which is named for the experimental work of the early-twentieth-century psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik, describes the ability of incomplete tasks to dominate our attention. It tells us that if you simply stop whatever you are doing at five p.m. and declare, “I’m done with work until tomorrow,” you’ll likely struggle to keep your mind clear of professional issues, as the many obligations left unresolved in your mind will, as in Bluma Zeigarnik’s experiments, keep battling for your attention throughout the evening (a battle that they’ll often win).",Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World,Cal Newport,B00X47ZVXM,,yellow,,location,1669,2019-02-02 04:56:00+00:00
"The implication of this line of research is that providing your conscious brain time to rest enables your unconscious mind to take a shift sorting through your most complex professional challenges.

These measures, however, lacked influence on my day-to-day behavior because there was nothing I could do in the short term that could immediately generate a noticeable change to this long-term metric.

"In my experience, the monastic philosophy makes many knowledge workers defensive.

"The twenty-five-to thirty-four-year-olds who thought they watched fifteen hours a week, it turns out, watch more like twenty-eight hours. This bad estimate of time usage is not unique to British television watching. When you consider different groups self-estimating different behaviors, similar gaps stubbornly remain. In a Wall Street Journal article on the topic, business writer Laura Vanderkam pointed out several more such examples. A survey by the National Sleep Foundation revealed that Americans think they’re sleeping, on average, somewhere around seven hours a night. The American Time Use Survey, which has people actually measure their sleep, corrected this number to 8.6 hours. Another study found that people who claimed to work sixty to sixty-four hours per week were actually averaging more like forty-four hours per week, while those claiming to work more than seventy-five hours were actually working less than fifty-five.",Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World,Cal Newport,B00X47ZVXM,,yellow,,location,2456,2019-02-02 04:56:00+00:00

"My guess is that Adam Grant doesn’t work substantially more hours than the average professor at an elite research institution (generally speaking, this is a group prone to workaholism), but he still manages to produce more than just about anyone else in his field. I argue that his approach to batching helps explain this paradox. In particular, by consolidating his work into intense and uninterrupted pulses, he’s leveraging the following law of productivity: High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus) If you believe this formula, then Grant’s habits make sense: By maximizing his intensity when he works, he maximizes the results he produces per unit of time spent working.",Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World,Cal Newport,B00X47ZVXM,,yellow,,location,449,2019-02-02 04:56:00+00:00
PART 1 The Idea,Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World,Cal Newport,B00X47ZVXM,".h1

Arguments why deep work is important.

1. Deep work is valuable economically because it helps you to learn challenging things quickly and produce high quality results.

2. Deep work is rare because of difficulty in measuring value of individual contributions leads us to prioritize shallow work that signals that we're constantly busy.

3. Deep work is meaningful. We thrive when we are focused on positive goals that stretch our limits. This helps us see the inherent meaning in the world and our work and prevents us from feeling isolated and alone.",yellow,h1,location,235,2019-02-02 04:56:00+00:00

"First, distraction remains a destroyer of depth. Therefore, the hub-and-spoke model provides a crucial template. Separate your pursuit of serendipitous encounters from your efforts to think deeply and build on these inspirations. You should try to optimize each effort separately, as opposed to mixing them together into a sludge that impedes both goals. Second, even when you retreat to a spoke to think deeply, when it’s reasonable to leverage the whiteboard effect, do so. By working side by side with someone on a problem, you can push each other toward deeper levels of depth, and therefore toward the generation of more and more valuable output as compared to working alone.",Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World,Cal Newport,B00X47ZVXM,,yellow,,location,1473,2019-02-02 04:56:00+00:00

"Once understood, we can connect this sacredness inherent in traditional craftsmanship to the world of knowledge work. To do so, there are two key observations we must first make. The first might be obvious but requires emphasis: There’s nothing intrinsic about the manual trades when it comes to generating this particular source of meaning. Any pursuit—be it physical or cognitive—that supports high levels of skill can also generate a sense of sacredness.",Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World,Cal Newport,B00X47ZVXM,,yellow,,location,984,2019-02-02 04:56:00+00:00
"Craftsmanship, Dreyfus and Kelly argue in their book’s conclusion, provides a key to reopening a sense of sacredness in a responsible manner. To illustrate this claim, they use as an organizing example an account of a master wheelwright—the now lost profession of shaping wooden wagon wheels. “Because each piece of wood is distinct, it has its own personality,” they write after a passage describing the details of the wheelwright’s craft. “The woodworker has an intimate relationship with the wood he works. Its subtle virtues call out to be cultivated and cared for.” In this appreciation for the “subtle virtues” of his medium, they note, the craftsman has stumbled onto something crucial in a post-Enlightenment world: a source of meaning sited outside the individual. The wheelwright doesn’t decide arbitrarily which virtues of the wood he works are valuable and which are not; this value is inherent in the wood and the task it’s meant to perform. As Dreyfus and Kelly explain, such sacredness is common to craftsmanship. The task of a craftsman, they conclude, “is not to generate meaning, but rather to cultivate in himself the skill of discerning the meanings that are already there.” This frees the craftsman of the nihilism of autonomous individualism, providing an ordered world of meaning. At the same time, this meaning seems safer than the sources cited in previous eras. The wheelwright, the authors imply, cannot easily use the inherent quality of a piece of pine to justify a despotic monarchy.",Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World,Cal Newport,B00X47ZVXM,,yellow,,location,969,2019-02-02 04:56:00+00:00
"“The world used to be, in its various forms, a world of sacred, shining things,” Dreyfus and Kelly explain early in the book. “The shining things now seem far away.” What happened between then and now? The short answer, the authors argue, is Descartes. From Descartes’s skepticism came the radical belief that the individual seeking certainty trumped a God or king bestowing truth. The resulting Enlightenment, of course, led to the concept of human rights and freed many from oppression. But as Dreyfus and Kelly emphasize, for all its good in the political arena, in the domain of the metaphysical this thinking stripped the world of the order and sacredness essential to creating meaning. In a post-Enlightenment world we have tasked ourselves to identify what’s meaningful and what’s not, an exercise that can seem arbitrary and induce a creeping nihilism. “The Enlightenment’s metaphysical embrace of the autonomous individual leads not just to a boring life,” Dreyfus and Kelly worry; “it leads almost inevitably to a nearly unlivable one.”",Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World,Cal Newport,B00X47ZVXM,,yellow,,location,958,2019-02-02 04:56:00+00:00
"We often think of illegality as something that happens most where the state is weak. But recent work by David Robinson on violence and by Eric Tagliacozzo on smuggling suggests this is an oversimplification.50 There is little money to be made from brigandage in remote and lightly populated places. The wealth and power of cities creates opportunities in which men of violence can flourish. Local nodes of state administration can also be promising sites for criminality. __Places where multiple administrative systems overlap create spaces in which illicit activity can occur, cracks through which it can fall unnoticed. For the smuggler, the presence of state officials creates the possibilities for corruption.__ Corrupt officials can actually reduce uncertainty for the smuggler by ensuring that the organs of the state “look the other way” at crucial moments.",The Art of Being Governed: Everyday Politics in Late Imperial China,Michael Szonyi,B071254CJZ,,yellow,,location,1938,2018-09-18 04:56:00+00:00
"Households enacted their own strategies for managing their relationship with the agents of the state, keeping them at bay wherever possible; finding ways to comply with them at minimal cost and, as we shall see in subsequent chapters, manipulating the resources created by compliance to gain advantage in other spheres. What generalizations are possible about these strategies? The first core principle of their strategizing was to insulate family members from state impositions by specifying or concentrating them as narrowly as possible. ... A second core principle of this strategizing was to increase predictability, ... The third core principle was that all descendants of the patriarch should share in the inherited obligations. ... __Absent entirely from the documents is mention of any ethic of service or loyalty to the state.__ This was simply not part of the internal considerations of the family.",The Art of Being Governed: Everyday Politics in Late Imperial China,Michael Szonyi,B071254CJZ,,yellow,,location,1220,2018-08-30 04:56:00+00:00
"One common feature of the family strategies explored in this book is that they are accessible to us because they were recorded. But notation was not just a convenient (to us) side effect of the strategy; it was actually part of the strategy itself. For at the core of many family strategies was managing how the state and its agents perceived the family. ... Because the way one was inscribed in state records affected how one was governed, Ming subjects learned to use that language, and the principles and practices it served, to their advantage. They sought to manage how they were represented in the state archive. The ways documents were produced, circulated, and archived mattered in the lives of ordinary people in Ming. In a sense this book is a study of the social consequences of Ming bureaucratic practices.",The Art of Being Governed: Everyday Politics in Late Imperial China,Michael Szonyi,B071254CJZ,,yellow,,location,4021,2018-09-18 04:56:00+00:00
"The chief reason states create archives is as a tool to aid in seeing their population. As James Scott has shown, the modern state seeks to create a detailed “map” of its population and its territory, and such maps both depict and enable state interventions.32 But efforts to make such maps did not begin with modernity. Earlier states had also made maps in order to render their population more legible. It is too simplistic to dismiss these efforts on the grounds that premodern states lacked the technology to produce the same maps as modern states. Premodern states had different technical capacities from modern states, to be sure, but they also had different ambitions. Just like modern states, premodern states engaged in a calculus that evaluated the returns from greater legibility against the administrative burdens it imposed. ... To use Scott’s term, the early Qing state did not “see” the military households; it saw right through them. The social organizations that the people of Tongshan and Fuquan created, and that found physical expression in the Guandi temple and the Quan ancestral hall, were their responses to this situation. They were unseen by the state, and they decided to find a way to make it possible for the state to see them. The families in these organizations were not made legible by the state. They made themselves legible.33",The Art of Being Governed: Everyday Politics in Late Imperial China,Michael Szonyi,B071254CJZ,,yellow,,location,3884,2018-09-18 04:56:00+00:00

"Zhu Yuanzhang’s approach to the issue is captured by his celebrated though probably apocryphal remark that “We maintain a million soldiers without costing the people a single grain of rice.”8 The hereditary military system was designed to ensure a constant supply of manpower to fill army ranks. The military logistics and supply system was designed to ensure the army would be self-supporting. The two approaches were two parts of a single project with a consistent logic. Zhu Yuanzhang wanted his army to be a self-sustaining closed system, requiring neither inputs of labor power nor inputs of food to support that labor power.

"Owning land was a stable, low-risk investment. This created possibilities for strategizing. As we have already seen, military households who had been given allotments of land might later lose the usage rights for their allotments for any one of a number of reasons. Their members deserted to avoid the tax burden or they were transferred to new operational deployments. Or they sold or transferred the land willingly in exchange for cash. If the value of the land rose, they tried to recover it so that they could profit from the increase in price. They did so by asserting their special claims within the distinctive regulatory system, by arbitraging the ways in which military colony land was not exactly the same as ordinary private land.",The Art of Being Governed: Everyday Politics in Late Imperial China,Michael Szonyi,B071254CJZ,,yellow,,location,2754,2018-09-18 04:56:00+00:00
"the new Qing rulers did not overhaul the tax system nor, despite the turmoil of the transition, conduct a comprehensive census or a land registration. Even after the threat from Koxinga was neutralized, an enumeration of key tax data was not thought crucial. To us this seems strange. Modern states view comprehensive, accurate statistical information about populations as a pre-requisite for effective governance. Officials in premodern Chinese states had no such illusions. Early Qing officials for the most part thought that they had inherited sufficient information to do their job. The surviving Ming records assigned tax obligations to the registered households in each jurisdiction. If these obligations were met, then the necessary revenue would be delivered. If revenue proved insufficient to meet expenses, then the existing records provided the framework to levy surtaxes.",The Art of Being Governed: Everyday Politics in Late Imperial China,Michael Szonyi,B071254CJZ,,yellow,,location,3556,2018-09-18 04:56:00+00:00
"After the fall of the Ming, in his magisterial yet wistful summary of historical geography, Gu Yanwu summarized the various problems of the military colony system in Fujian in the later years of the dynasty, “There were cases where the land was extant but there was no soldier [to farm it], and cases where a soldier [was assigned to] but there was no land.” Clearly Gu does not mean that lands or soldiers have actually disappeared. He is using the language of the scholar-official to point to the distinction between reality and regulatory position. Regulatory position is simply another way of saying how reality appears to regulators. Gu is pointing out that there is a difference between this version of reality and everyday reality. He continues, “There were cases where a single soldier controlled three or four allotments of military colony land, and cases where a single allotment of land was shared by three or four soldiers.”41 For all the dramatic changes of the Ming economy, the regulatory system that had been created at the start of the dynasty continued to shape the working of the economy even to the end.",The Art of Being Governed: Everyday Politics in Late Imperial China,Michael Szonyi,B071254CJZ,,yellow,,location,2932,2018-09-18 04:56:00+00:00

"The Chinese term for the perpetrators of these raids is wokou, Japanese (literally dwarf) bandits. A century ago, historians in China interpreted the wokou raids as a Japanese war on China—obviously they were drawing parallels with their own time. After 1949, scholars in the PRC recast the violence as class warfare, an attack by an emergent merchant class on the feudal political order. Neither of these explanations for the upsurge in violence seems very persuasive today, but no consensus has replaced them. ... Who were the wokou? In most of the historical sources, there is a simple, unambiguous answer: the Japanese dwarf bandits. This terminology is an attempt to resolve ambiguity by ethnicizing the problem, imposing solid categories onto fluid groups and shifting behaviors. But even at the time, local knowledge pointed out again and again that this was not accurate. One local official estimated that of the people who were labeled foreign bandits, actual foreigners accounted for fewer than one in ten, with perhaps another 20% coming from Okinawa, at the time a Ming tributary. Sacrificing strict mathematical accuracy to make his point, he continued that half of all foreign bandits were from the Zhejiang coast and fully 90% from the three large coastal prefectures of Fujian—Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Fuzhou. “Though they are called foreign bandits, in fact most are ordinary people who belong to registered households.”13",The Art of Being Governed: Everyday Politics in Late Imperial China,Michael Szonyi,B071254CJZ,,yellow,,location,1706,2018-09-05 04:56:00+00:00

The schemes of officers who were simultaneously smugglers depended not on successfully evading the state but on taking advantage of their connections to it.

"Many soldiers and their families on the southeast coast exploited their connections to the military to get rich through smuggling and piracy. Of course not all soldiers were smugglers, nor all smugglers soldiers. Rather the point is that illegal behavior was not a straightforward function of separation and distance from enforcement and regulatory mechanisms. On the contrary, soldiers, officers and their kin were able to profit from illegal trade precisely because of their proximity to the state. Their actions fall further along the axes from compliance to resistance than the optimization strategies discussed in previous chapters. But terms like resistance or misconduct still fail to describe this behavior fully because they fail to capture that it was only possible because of the ways households were embedded in these institutions. Military households could do the things they did because they engaged with state systems in particular ways. In chapter 1, we saw them attempting to calculate the costs of service and find ways to minimize or redistribute those costs. In this chapter, we see them calculating, though less explicitly, the advantages that can be gained by continuing to bear the cost of service. The consequences of their calibration undermined the purpose of the very institution in which they served, but this does not seem to have been of much concern to the men involved.",The Art of Being Governed: Everyday Politics in Late Imperial China,Michael Szonyi,B071254CJZ,,yellow,,location,2018,2018-09-18 04:56:00+00:00
"Documents like Yan Kuimei’s account, written by members of families for their own reasons and reproduced in their genealogies, can provide answers to the two core questions of this book. These texts, written by ordinary people to deal with and comment on everyday problems, are perhaps our best source to study the history of the common people in Ming times. They may well be the closest we can get to the voice of the ordinary Ming subject. These texts reveal the mobilization of manpower for the Ming army from the perspective not of the mobilizing state but of the people mobilized. They show how people dealt with the challenges posed and seized the opportunities offered by living with the Ming state. ... To label this type of interaction state-society relations would not be wrong, but it would be simplistic, anachronistic, and anthropomorphic. Society is made up of social actors—individuals and families—but social actors make their own choices. Most of the time they do not act on behalf of or for the sake of society, or even think in such terms, but in the pursuit of their own interests as they understand them. Nor is the state a conscious or even a coherent unified actor. States do not interact with people. Or rather, people rarely experience this interaction as such. They interact with the state’s agents—with functionaries and bureaucrats. They follow procedures; they fill out forms and hand over their money. Our own experience tells us that people can behave in different ways in such interactions. I can follow the instructions of state officials to the letter and fill out forms meticulously, precisely, conscientiously, and honestly. Or I can refuse to conform to the process. If pushed, I might even flee the state or take up arms against it. But the vast majority of interactions with the state take place somewhere between these two extremes, and this is as true of people in the past as it is for me in the present. ... To move beyond the thin set of choices offered by the binary of compliance versus resistance, I use instead the term “everyday politics.”7 “Everyday politics,” writes Ben Kerkvliet, “is people embracing, complying with, adjusting, and contesting norms and rules regarding authority over, production of, or allocation of resources and doing so in quiet, mundane, and subtle expressions and acts.”8 To speak of everyday political strategies is to suggest skills and competencies that can be acquired and transmitted or, in other words, an art of being governed. This phrase is obviously inspired both by Foucault’s concept of the art of government and Scott’s elaboration of the art of not being governed. Just as Foucault traces shifts in emphasis in the arts of governing, it should be possible to trace histories of the art of being governed.9 ... Their art of being governed did not consist of a basic choice between being governed or not being governed. Rather, it involved decisions about when to be governed, about how best to be governed, about how to maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of being governed.",The Art of Being Governed: Everyday Politics in Late Imperial China,Michael Szonyi,B071254CJZ,,yellow,,location,285,2018-08-30 04:56:00+00:00
"In the standard narrative of Ming history today the market is a central player. According to this narrative, widespread commercialization in the fifteenth century led to a habituation to the market and this in turn had manifold effects, including changes to popular culture and the distribution of new skills that served further economic development. But a cultural pattern of seeing the world in terms of things that could be bought and sold already long had been part of everyday life in Fujian. Did the people of the region develop their strategies and contractual solutions by applying their previous experience with commerce to political relationships? Or did they devise through practical and discursive work innovative solutions in response to the challenges of their political relationships, and then apply these same solutions to commercial challenges? In other words, did the economy of state obligations precondition families to find solutions that turned out to work well in the market economy? This is of course a chicken-and-egg argument whose implications are no less profound for the argument’s being unsolvable. It complicates the notion of a natural moral economy that precedes and is undermined by market penetration. It suggests that long before the systematic efforts of modern state regimes penetrated Chinese society, ordinary Chinese people had developed a sophisticated economy of state interaction, a system of managing state exactions and expectations. In the genealogies we can see them trying to figure out the best way to inhabit the institution, to live up to its letter while maximizing their own interests, and using the appearance of compliance to their advantage in other negotiations.",The Art of Being Governed: Everyday Politics in Late Imperial China,Michael Szonyi,B071254CJZ,,yellow,,location,1251,2018-09-18 04:56:00+00:00
"Thus one unintended consequence of the hereditary conscription system and the troop settlement policy was to incentivize widely separated kin to maintain relations with one another over time. There is nothing “natural” about maintaining such ties. Centuries later, scholars would notice that Chinese emigrant families also managed to maintain unity even when they were dispersed around the world. Philip Kuhn and others have argued that this capacity must have been honed by the long experience of sojourning scholars, merchants, and laborers migrating within China.18 The policies of the Ming military may also have provided another precedent for the patterns of family behavior that would later shape Overseas Chinese society. State institutions lay behind this type of historical experience of deterritorialization and family dispersion, and state institutions also shed light on the incentives and strategic opportunities that encouraged dispersed families to create and maintain long-distance social relations. The people involved in these relations invoked the rhetoric of family, to be sure, but their choices were motivated by strategic considerations and not simply cultural predispositions.",The Art of Being Governed: Everyday Politics in Late Imperial China,Michael Szonyi,B071254CJZ,,yellow,,location,1543,2018-09-18 04:56:00+00:00
"The Ming conscription system, initially devised on earlier models to meet the immediate concerns of the dynastic founding and later reformed to accord with changing realities, operated according to its own logics. The system was genealogical and algorithmic with respect to law. The law stated that the obligation to serve was hereditary and outlined how hereditary was to be interpreted. In theory, each time a serving soldier retired or died, his replacement was to be determined through the application of an algorithm. In its simplest form, the algorithm stated that a serving soldier was replaced by his son. If every serving soldier at the time of the founding emperor had had one and only one son, the algorithm would have remained in this extremely simple form. But society is more complicated than an algorithm. The households registered in the system operated according to different logics that the algorithm could not comprehend. The countless internal family debates over who should go to the army next were each of them articulations of these different logics. From the perspective of the household, the selection system was an object of decision-making and strategy. The question of who from a larger group of eligible kin should fulfill the military service obligation was recognized as an internal matter for the kin to decide. It is also clear that once such a decision was taken, state agents were expected to accept it, and even, as the various disputes show, to enforce it. The various statutes, substatutes, and precedents relating to conscription in Ming legal texts were basically efforts to revise the algorithm to deal with greater social complexity.",The Art of Being Governed: Everyday Politics in Late Imperial China,Michael Szonyi,B071254CJZ,,yellow,,location,1208,2018-09-18 04:56:00+00:00

"Institutional legacies constrain the choices open to every state. Even a state established through conquest is subject to legacies of the institutions of its defeated predecessor. Even if the conquering state dissolves or replaces the formal institutions of its predecessor, institutional legacies may still shape the choices of people living in new states. Detached from their original institutional context, residual elements from defunct institutions can take on new life as elements of everyday politics under the new situation. The end of the Ming meant—eventually—the end of the Ming military system. Some parts of the institution were eliminated; others were incorporated into the civilian administrative system. This was a gradual and piecemeal process that took almost a century from the fall of the Ming in 1644. But the institution still left many legacies, both in the interim period and beyond. Some, such as the persistence of distinctive tax levies, were top-down legacies created by officials dealing with the challenges of the transition. Others were produced from the bottom up. People within the system, and their descendants, sought to retain prerogatives granted them in the past by the now-defunct institution. Or they tried to rework elements of the institution in order to deal with new situations. Where they were successful, these legacies became political resources to be redeployed in different contexts. Thus the institution continued to produce new social relations even after it had formally ceased to exist.",The Art of Being Governed: Everyday Politics in Late Imperial China,Michael Szonyi,B071254CJZ,,yellow,,location,3489,2018-09-18 04:56:00+00:00

"While military officials must have been happy to see slots filled by serving soldiers, the rotational approach was open to abuse. Like many other aspects of the conscription, problems appeared in the early decades of the fifteenth century, as the long-term implications of the everyday politics of the system started to become apparent. In 1436, an official in north China noticed that military households had set up rotation systems as a way to get out of their obligations. “Fathers, sons, and brothers are illegally arranging their own transfers. [The officers] in the guards to which they are assigned accept bribes and allow them to replace one another. Each person serves for a year, and rotates one after the other. The one actually serving whiles away his time and before his term is over he deserts. Every year conscription must be implemented, but the ranks stay empty for a long time.”46 Arrangements like those of the Dalun Cai or the Jinghai Rong were not attempts to beat the system so much as attempts to comply with it in ways that the family members could more easily accept. Their strategies reduced uncertainty and enhanced predictability. When this type of strategy worked as planned, it increased the likelihood that slots would remain filled, that serving soldiers would always be on station. It relieved state agents of the burden and costs of monitoring and ensuring compliance. Perhaps some officials felt that the strategy had a certain appeal because it was consistent with fundamental orientations of the Ming constitution. It assigned the costs of keeping the state running to the lowest possible level of society, relying on local initiative to get the job done. But abuses multiplied, and eventually in 1553, a substatute titled “Soldiers may not surreptitiously replace one another” came into force. It declared, “only when a soldier is old or weak can he request to be replaced. It is not permitted to present a private document agreeing to a ten year or five year rotation through branches.”47",The Art of Being Governed: Everyday Politics in Late Imperial China,Michael Szonyi,B071254CJZ,,yellow,,location,1117,2018-09-18 04:56:00+00:00

How could we understand the results of both the Three Population Test and the Four Population Test? We proposed that more than fifteen thousand years ago, there was a population living in northern Eurasia that was not the primary ancestral population of the present-day inhabitants of the region. Some people from this population migrated east across Siberia and contributed to the population that crossed the Bering land bridge and gave rise to Native Americans. Others migrated west and contributed to Europeans.

"All this changed with the emergence of the Yamnaya culture around five thousand years ago, whose economy was based on sheep and cattle herding. The Yamnaya emerged from previous cultures of the steppe and its periphery and exploited the steppe resources far more effectively than their predecessors. They spread over a vast region, from Hungary in Europe to the foothills of the Altai Mountains in central Asia, and in many places replaced the disparate cultures that had preceded them with a more homogeneous way of life. One of the inventions that drove the spread of the Yamnaya was the wheel, whose geographic origin is not known because once it appeared—at least a few hundred years before the rise of the Yamnaya—it spread across Eurasia like wildfire. Wagons using wheels may have been adopted by the Yamnaya from their neighbors to the south: the Maikop culture in the Caucasus region between the Black and Caspian seas. For the Maikop, as for many cultures across Eurasia, the wheel was profoundly important. But for the people of the steppe, it was if anything even more important, as it made possible an economy and culture that were entirely new. By hitching their animals to wagons, the Yamnaya could take water and supplies with them into the open steppe and exploit the vast lands that had previously been inaccessible. By taking advantage of another innovation—the horse, which had recently been domesticated in a more eastern part of the steppe, and which made cattle herding more efficient as a single rider could herd many times the number of animals than could be herded by a person on foot—the Yamnaya also became vastly more productive.19",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,2069,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00

We have similar findings from Native American individuals from southern Argentina dating to around eight thousand years ago, and Native American individuals from southern Brazil dating to around ten thousand years ago. The same applies to Native Americans from the islands off British Columbia, who appear to have been part of a continuous population for around six thousand years, even if the local continuity does not clearly go back more than ten thousand years.31 All are more closely related to Native Americans who live in the same regions today than to Native Americans far away.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,3140,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00

We found that non-African genomes today are around 1.5 to 2.1 percent Neanderthal in origin,24 with the higher numbers in East Asians and the lower numbers in Europeans, despite the fact that Europe was the homeland of the Neanderthals.25 We now know that at least part of the explanation is dilution. Ancient DNA from Europeans who lived before nine thousand years ago shows that pre-farming Europeans had just as much Neanderthal ancestry as East Asians do today.26 The reduction in Neanderthal ancestry in present-day Europeans is due to the fact that they harbor some of their ancestry from a group of people who separated from all other non-Africans prior to the mixture with Neanderthals (the story of this early-splitting group revealed by ancient DNA is told in part II of this book). The spread of farmers with this inheritance diluted the Neanderthal ancestry in Europe, but not in East Asia.27",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,1060,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00
"The archaeologist Marija Gimbutas has argued that Yamnaya society was unprecedentedly sex-biased and stratified. The Yamnaya left behind great mounds, about 80 percent of which had male skeletons at the center, often with evidence of violent injuries and buried amidst fearsome metal daggers and axes.22 Gimbutas argued that the arrival of the Yamnaya in Europe heralded a shift in the power relationships between the sexes. It coincided with the decline of “Old Europe,” which according to Gimbutas was a society with little evidence of violence, and in which females played a central social role as is apparent in the ubiquitous Venus figurines. In her reconstruction, “Old Europe” was replaced by a male-centered society, evident not only in the archaeology but also in the male-centered Greek, Norse, and Hindu mythologies of the Indo-European cultures plausibly spread by the Yamnaya.23",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,4164,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00

"The analysis of the Mal’ta genome made it clear that Native Americans derive about a third of their ancestry from the Ancient North Eurasians, and the remainder from East Asians. It is this major mixture that explains why Europeans are genetically closer to Native Americans than they are to East Asians. Our unpublished manuscript claiming that Native Americans descend from a mixture of East Asian and West Eurasian related lineages had been correct, but it was just not the whole story; the paper was overtaken by events in the fast-moving field of ancient DNA. What Willerslev and colleagues found went far beyond what we had been able to do by relying on only modern populations. The Willerslev team not only proved that Native Americans issued from population mixture—which we had not succeeded in doing as we could not rule out an alternative scenario—but they also showed that the mixture was part of a larger story. The finding that several of the great populations outside of Africa today are profoundly mixed was at odds with what most scientists expected. Prior to the genome revolution, I, like most others, had assumed that the big genetic clusters of populations we see today reflect the deep splits of the past. But in fact the big clusters today are themselves the result of mixtures of very different populations that existed earlier. We have since detected similar patterns in every population we have analyzed: East Asians, South Asians, West Africans, southern Africans. There was never a single trunk population in the human past. It has been mixtures all the way down.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,1685,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00
"My laboratory’s first major discovery using the Four Population Test came when we tested the widely held view that Native Americans and East Asians are “sister populations” that descend from a common ancestral branch that separated earlier from the ancestors of Europeans and sub-Saharan Africans. To our surprise, we found that at mutations not shared with sub-Saharan Africans, Europeans are more closely related to Native Americans than they are to East Asians. It would be tempting to argue that this observation has a trivial explanation, such as Native Americans having some ancestry from European migrants over the last five hundred years. But we found the same pattern in every Native American population we studied, including those we could prove had no European admixture. The scenario of Native Americans and Europeans descending from a common population that split earlier from East Asians was also contradicted by the data. Something was deeply wrong with the standard tree model of population relationships.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,1629,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00

"The Star Cluster work rests on Y chromosomes and mitochondrial DNA. What can whole-genome analysis add? When whole-genome data are used to reconstruct the size of the ancestral population of most agricultural groups in the last ten thousand years, they document population growth throughout this period, with no evidence of the Bronze Age population bottlenecks detected from Y chromosomes.29 This is not what one would expect from averaging the mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosomes. Instead, it is clear that the Y chromosome was a nonrepresentative part of the genome where certain genetic types were more successful at being passed down to later generations than others. In principle, one possible explanation for this is natural selection, whereby some Y chromosomes gave a biological advantage to those who carried them, such as increased fertility. But the fact that this genetic pattern manifested itself around the same time in multiple places around the world—in a period coinciding with the rise of socially stratified societies—is too striking a pattern to be explained by natural selection at multiple independently occurring advantageous mutations. I think a more plausible explanation is that in this period, it began to be possible for single males to accumulate so much power that they could not only gain access to large numbers of females, but they could also pass on their social prestige to subsequent generations and ensure that their male descendants were similarly successful. This process caused the Y chromosomes these males carried to increase in frequency generation after generation, leaving a genetic scar that speaks volumes about past societies.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,4200,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00

"DNA has the power to overturn expectations from other fields, though, and in this case it has also revealed a surprise about sex-biased mixture. Today, almost every Pacific island population harbors some of its ancestry from people of mainland East Asian origin. As described in part II, this ancestry derives from people whose ancestors originated on Taiwan island and who invented long-distance seafaring and used it to disperse their people, language, and genes. But almost every Pacific island population also harbors Papuan ancestry related to the indigenous hunter-gatherers of the island of New Guinea. Surprisingly, in light of the theme that males from an expanding population tend to mix with local females, initial studies of mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosomes showed that the mixed populations of the Pacific today derive most of their East Asian origin DNA not from male but from female ancestors.38 One explanation that has been suggested for this pattern is that in early Pacific island societies, property usually passed down the female line and males were the primary people who moved across islands.39 But there is another process that may also have contributed. As described in part II, my laboratory showed that the first people of the open Pacific had little Papuan-related ancestry.40 We showed that later west-to-east waves of migration of people of mixed Papuan and mainland East Asian ancestry explain the ubiquity of Papuan ancestry in the remote Pacific today. If males from this later-arriving population had social advantages relative to the previously resident population, this could have resulted in newly arriving males of primarily Papuan ancestry mixing with previously established females of primarily East Asian–related ancestry.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,4264,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00

"We also found a second line of evidence for infertility in hybrids of Neanderthals and modern humans—a line of evidence that had nothing to do with the X chromosome. When reduced fertility is observed in hybrid males, the genes responsible tend to be highly active in the male reproductive tissue, causing malfunctions of sperm. So a prediction of the hypothesis of male hybrid infertility suggested to me by evolutionary biologist Daven Presgraves after I showed him the X chromosome evidence is that genes unusually active in the germ cells of a man’s testicles will have less Neanderthal ancestry on average than genes that are most active in other body tissues. When we looked in real data, Presgraves’s prediction was exactly borne out.40",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,1179,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00

"But the chromosomes themselves are mosaics of even smaller tiles. For example, the first third of a chromosome a woman passes down to her egg might come from her father and the last two-thirds from her mother, the result of a splicing together of her father’s and mother’s copies of that chromosome in her ovaries. Females create an average of about forty-five new splices when producing eggs, while males create about twenty-six splices when producing sperm, for a total of about seventy-one new splices per generation.20 So it is that as we trace each generation back further into the past, a person’s genome is derived from an ever-increasing number of spliced-together ancestral fragments. This means that our genomes hold within them a multitude of ancestors. Any person’s genome is derived from 47 stretches of DNA corresponding to the chromosomes transmitted by mother and father plus mitochondrial DNA. One generation back, a person’s genome is derived from about 118 (47 plus 71) stretches of DNA transmitted by his or her parents. Two generations back, the number of ancestral stretches of DNA grows to around 189 (47 plus 71 plus another 71) transmitted by four grandparents. Look even further back in time, and the additional increase in ancestral stretches of DNA every generation is rapidly overtaken by the doubling of ancestors. Ten generations back, for example, the number of ancestral stretches of DNA is around 757 but the number of ancestors is 1,024, guaranteeing that each person has several hundred ancestors from whom he or she has received no DNA whatsoever. Twenty generations in the past, the number of ancestors is almost a thousand times greater than the number of ancestral stretches of DNA in a person’s genome, so it is a certainty that each person has not inherited any DNA from the great majority of his or her actual ancestors. These calculations mean that a person’s genealogy, as reconstructed from historical records, is not the same as his or her genetic inheritance. The Bible and the chronicles of royal families record who begat whom over dozens of generations. Yet even if the genealogies are accurate, Queen Elizabeth II of England almost certainly inherited no DNA from William of Normandy, who conquered England in 1066 and who is believed to be her ancestor twenty-four generations back in time.21 This does not mean that Queen Elizabeth II did not inherit DNA from ancestors that far back, just that it is expected that only about 1,751 of her 16,777,216 twenty-fourth-degree genealogical ancestors contributed any DNA to her. This is such a small fraction that the only way William could plausibly be her genetic ancestor is if he was her genealogical ancestor in thousands of different lineage paths, which seems unlikely even considering the high level of inbreeding in the British royal family.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,621,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00

"The genetic data from Indians today also reveal something about the history of differences in social power between men and women. Around 20 to 40 percent of Indian men and around 30 to 50 percent of eastern European men have a Y-chromosome type that, based on the density of mutations separating people who carry it, descends in the last sixty-eight hundred to forty-eight hundred years from the same male ancestor.25 In contrast, the mitochondrial DNA, passed down along the female line, is almost entirely restricted to India, suggesting that it may have nearly all come from the ASI, even in the north. The only possible explanation for this is major migration between West Eurasia and India in the Bronze Age or afterward.

"The genomic evidence of the antiquity of inequality—between men and women, and between people of the same sex but with greater and lesser power—is sobering in light of the undeniable persistence of inequality today. One possible response might be to conclude that inequality is part of human nature and that we should just accept it. But I think the lesson is just the opposite. Constant effort to struggle against our demons—against the social and behavioral habits that are built into our biology—is one of the ennobling behaviors of which we humans as a species are capable, and which has been critical to many of our triumphs and achievements. Evidence of the antiquity of inequality should motivate us to deal in a more sophisticated way with it today, and to behave a little better in our own time.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,favorite,location,4301,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00
"The recognition that Africa is central to the human story has, paradoxically, distracted attention from the last fifty thousand years of its prehistory. The intensive study of what happened in Africa before fifty thousand years ago is motivated by a universal recognition of the importance of the Middle to Later Stone Age transition in Africa and the Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition at the doorstep of Africa, those great leaps forward in recognizably modern human behavior attested to in the archaeological record. However, scholars have shown limited interest in Africa after this period. When I go to talks, a common slip of the tongue is that “we left Africa,” as if the protagonists of the modern human story must be followed to Eurasia. The mistaken impression is that once Africa gave birth to the ancestral population of non-Africans, the African story ended, and the people who remained on the continent were static relics of the past, jettisoned from the main plot, unchanging over the last fifty thousand years.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,3678,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00
"we were arguing that this was a pioneer population of limited size that moved into a human vacuum, expanding dramatically wherever it arrived. The genetic data provide support for the correctness of this hypothesis in its broad outlines. As we applied the Four Population Test time and again, it became clear to us that the great majority of Native Americans, from populations in northern North America down to southern South America, can be broadly described as branches of one tree, forming a sharp contrast to patterns of population relationships in Eurasia. Most populations branched cleanly off the central trunk with little subsequent mixture. The splits proceeded roughly in a north-to-south direction, consistent with the idea that as populations traveled south, groups peeled off and settled, remaining in approximately the same place ever since. The most striking exception to this pattern was the less than thirteen-thousand-year-old infant associated with the Clovis culture who was found in Montana very close to the present-day Canadian border. The Clovis infant came from a lineage different from that of present-day inhabitants of neighboring Canada, reflecting major population movements that must have happened later.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,3131,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00

"Ancient DNA studies have also now made it clear just how wrong the Clovis First idea is—how it misses a whole deep branch of Native American population history. In 2014, Eske Willerslev and his colleagues published whole-genome data from the remains of an infant excavated in Montana whose archaeological context assigned him to the Clovis culture and whose radiocarbon age was a bit after thirteen thousand years ago.11 Their analysis showed that this infant was definitely from the same ancestral population as many Native Americans, but his genetic data also showed that by the time he lived, a deep split among Native American populations had already developed. The remains from the Clovis infant were on one side of that split: the side that contributed the lion’s share of ancestry to all Native American populations in Mesoamerica and South America today. The other side of the split includes Native American peoples who today live in eastern and central Canada.

"Figure 13. Having migrated out of Africa and the Near East, modern human pioneer populations spread throughout Eurasia (1). By at least thirty-nine thousand years ago, one group founded a lineage of European hunter-gatherers that persisted largely uninterrupted for more than twenty thousand years (2). Eventually, groups derived from an eastern branch of this founding population of European hunter-gatherers spread west (3), displaced previous groups, and were eventually themselves pushed out of northern Europe by the spread of glacial ice, shown at its maximum extent (top right). As the glaciers receded, western Europe was repeopled from the southwest (4) by a population that had managed to persist for tens of thousands of years and was related to an approximately thirty-five-thousand-year-old individual from far western Europe. A later human migration, following the first strong warming period, had an even larger impact, with a spread from the southeast (5) that not only transformed the population of western Europe but also homogenized the populations of Europe and the Near East.

"We sat together and came up with new names for ancient Indian groups. We wrote that the people of India today are the outcome of mixtures between two highly differentiated populations, “Ancestral North Indians” (ANI) and “Ancestral South Indians” (ASI), who before their mixture were as different from each other as Europeans and East Asians are today. The ANI are related to Europeans, central Asians, Near Easterners, and people of the Caucasus, but we made no claim about the location of their homeland or any migrations. The ASI descend from a population not related to any present-day populations outside India. We showed that the ANI and ASI had mixed dramatically in India. The result is that everyone in mainland India today is a mix, albeit in different proportions, of ancestry related to West Eurasians, and ancestry more closely related to diverse East Asian and South Asian populations.

"time in Eurasia, with multiple human populations arriving from Africa beginning at least 1.8 million years ago. These populations split into sister groups, diverged, and mixed again with each other and with new arrivals. Most of those groups have since gone extinct, at least in their “pure” forms. We have known for a while, from skeletons and archaeology, that there was some impressive human diversity prior to the migration of modern humans out of Africa. However, we did not know before ancient DNA was extracted and studied that Eurasia was a locus of human evolution that rivaled Africa. Against this background, the fierce debates about whether modern humans and Neanderthals interbred when they met in western Eurasia—which have been definitively resolved in favor of interbreeding events that made a contribution to billions of people living today—seem merely anticipatory. Europe is a peninsula, a modest-sized tip of Eurasia. Given the wide diversity of Denisovans and Neanderthals—already represented in DNA sequences from at least three populations separated from each other by hundreds of thousands of years, namely Siberian Denisovans, Australo-Denisovans, and Neanderthals—the right way to view these populations is as members of a loosely related family of highly evolved archaic humans who inhabited a vast region of Eurasia. Ancient DNA has allowed us to peer deep into time, and forced us to question our understanding of the past. If the first Neanderthal genome published in 2010 opened a sluice in the dam of knowledge about the deep past, the Denisova genome and subsequent ancient DNA discoveries opened the floodgates, producing a torrent of findings that have disrupted many of the comfortable understandings we had before.

"How did the farming and hunter-gatherer cultures coexist? Hints come from the Funnel Beaker culture, which is named for decorated clay vessels in graves dated after about sixty-three hundred years ago. The Funnel Beaker culture arose in a belt of land a few hundred kilometers from the Baltic Sea, which was not reached by the first wave of farmers, probably because their methods were not optimized for the heavy soils of northern Europe. Protected by the stronghold of their difficult-to-farm environment, and sustained by the fish and game resources of Baltic Europe, the northern hunter-gatherers had more than a thousand years to adapt to the challenge of farming. They adopted domesticated animals, and later crops, from their southern neighbors, but kept many elements of their hunter-gathering ways. The people of the Funnel Beaker culture were among those who built megaliths, the collective burial tombs made of stones so large it would have taken dozens of people to move them. The archaeologist Colin Renfrew suggested that megalith building might be a direct reflection of this boundary between southern farmers and hunter-gatherers turned farmers—a way of laying claim to territory, of distinguishing one people and culture from others.16 The genetic data may bear witness to this interaction, as there was clearly a stream of new migrants into the mixed population. Between six thousand and five thousand years ago, most of the northern gene pool was overtaken by farmer ancestry, and it was this mixture of a modest amount of hunter-gatherer-related ancestry and a large amount of Anatolian farmer–related ancestry—in a population that retained key elements of hunter-gatherer culture—that characterized the Funnel Beaker potters and many other contemporary Europeans.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,2041,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00

"But even if genetic changes—through coordinated natural selection on combinations of many mutations simultaneously—did enable new cognitive capacities, this is a very different scenario from Klein’s idea of a genetic switch. Genetic changes in this scenario are not a creative force abruptly enabling modern human behavior, but instead are responsive to nongenetic pressures imposed from the outside. In this scenario, it is not the case that the human population was unable to adapt because no one carried a mutation that allows a biological capability not previously present. Instead, the genetic formula that may have been necessary to drive the striking advances in human behavior and capacities that occurred during the Upper Paleolithic and Later Stone Ages is not particularly mysterious. The mutations necessary to facilitate modern human behavior were already in place, and many alternative combinations of these mutations could have increased in frequency together due to natural selection in response to changing needs imposed by the development of conceptual language or new environmental conditions. This in turn could have enabled further changes in lifestyle and innovation, in a self-reinforcing cycle. Thus, even if it is true that increases in the frequency of mutations were important in allowing modern humans to match their biology to new conditions during the Upper Paleolithic and Later Stone Age transition, what we now know about the nature of natural selection in humans and about the genetic encoding of many biological traits means it is unlikely that the first occurrence of these mutations triggered the great changes that followed. If we search for answers in a small number of mutations that arose shortly before the time of the Upper Paleolithic and Later Stone Age transitions, we are unlikely to find satisfying explanations of who we are.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,783,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00

"The Yamnaya—who the genetic data show were closely related to the source of the steppe ancestry in both India and Europe—are obvious candidates for spreading Indo-European languages to both these subcontinents of Eurasia. Remarkably, Patterson’s analysis of population history in India provided an additional line of evidence for this. His model of the Indian Cline was based on the idea of a simple mixture of two ancestral populations, the ANI and ASI. But when he looked harder and tested each of the Indian Cline groups in turn for whether it fit this model, he found that there were six groups that did not fit in the sense of having a higher ratio of steppe-related to Iranian farmer–related ancestry than was expected from this model. All six of these groups are in the Brahmin varna—with a traditional role in society as priests and custodians of the ancient texts written in the Indo-European Sanskrit language—despite the fact that Brahmins made up only about 10 percent of the groups Patterson tested. A natural explanation for this was that the ANI were not a homogeneous population when they mixed with the ASI, but instead contained socially distinct subgroups with characteristic ratios of steppe to Iranian-related ancestry. The people who were custodians of Indo-European language and culture were the ones with relatively more steppe ancestry, and because of the extraordinary strength of the caste system in preserving ancestry and social roles over generations, the ancient substructure in the ANI is evident in some of today’s Brahmins even after thousands of years.

"How do these genetic variations influence educational attainment? The obvious guess is that they have a direct effect on academic abilities, but that is probably wrong. A study of more than one hundred thousand Icelanders showed that the variations also increase the age at which a woman has her first child, and that this is a more powerful effect than the one on the number of years of education. It is possible that these variations exert their effect indirectly, by nudging people to defer having children, which makes it easier for them to complete their education.27 This shows that when we discover biological differences governing behavior, they may not be working in the way we naively assume. Average differences across populations in the frequencies of the mutations that affect educational attainment have not yet been identified. But a sobering finding is that older people in Iceland are systematically different from younger people in having a higher genetically predicted number of years of education.28 Augustine Kong, the lead author of the Icelandic study, showed that this reflects natural selection over the last century against people with more predicted education, likely because of selection for people who began having children at a younger age. Given that the genetic underpinnings of the number of years of education a person achieves have measurably changed within a century in a single population under the pressure of natural selection, it seems highly likely that the trait differs across populations too.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,4495,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00
"The discrepancy between the Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA patterns initially confused historians.26 But a possible explanation is that most of the ANI genetic input into India came from males. This pattern of sex-asymmetric population mixture is disturbingly familiar. Consider African Americans. The approximately 20 percent of ancestry that comes from Europeans derives in an almost four-to-one ratio from the male side.27 Consider Latinos from Colombia. The approximately 80 percent of ancestry that comes from Europeans is derived in an even more unbalanced way from males (a fifty-to-one ratio).28 I explore in part III what this means for the relationships among populations, and between males and females, but the common thread is that males from populations with more power tend to pair with females from populations with less.

"We already know from archaeology that humans probably arrived south of the ice sheets before the opening of the ice-free corridor, leaving remains at archaeological sites including Monte Verde and the Paisley Caves. But the big population explosion, marked by the Clovis people, only occurred once the ice-free corridor had opened. The genetic data could be giving evidence of early peopling of the Americas by a minimum of two very different groups moving in from Asia, perhaps along two different routes and at different times. If Population Y spread through parts of South America before the First Americans, then it seems likely that after this initial peopling, the First Americans advanced into nearly all of the territories the Population Y people had already visited, replacing them either completely or only partially, as in Amazonia. Population Y ancestry may have survived better in Amazonia than it did elsewhere because of the relative impenetrability of the Amazonian environment. This could have slowed down the movement of First Americans into the region enough to allow people living there to mix with the new migrants rather than simply being replaced.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,3271,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00
"The few remains that we do have are intriguing. Derevianko and his colleagues sent Pääbo a couple of molar teeth from Denisova Cave that contained mitochondrial DNA closely related to the finger bone. These teeth were enormous, beyond the range of nearly all teeth previously reported in the genus Homo. Large molars are thought to be biological adaptations to a diet that includes lots of tough uncooked plants. Prior to the Denisovans, the humans closest to us who were known to have had teeth of this size were the primarily plant-eating australopithecenes, like the famous “Lucy,” whose skeleton, dating to more than three million years ago, was found in the Awash Valley of Ethiopia. “Lucy” did not use tools and had a brain only slightly larger than chimpanzees’ after correcting for her smaller body size, but she walked upright.

"How is it that hybridization can lead to so much less genetic variation on chromosome X than on the rest of the genome? From studies of a variety of species across the animal kingdom, it is known that when two populations are separated for long enough, hybrid offspring have reduced fertility. In mammals like us, reduced fertility is much more common in males, and the genetic factors contributing to this reduced fertility are concentrated on chromosome X.35 So when two populations are so separated that their offspring have reduced fertility, but nevertheless mix together to produce hybrids, it is expected that there will be intense natural selection to remove the factors contributing to reduced fertility. This process will be especially evident on chromosome X because of the concentration of genes contributing to infertility on it. As a result, there tends to be natural selection on chromosome X for stretches of DNA from the population that contributed most of the hybrid population’s ancestry. This causes the hybrid population to derive its chromosome X almost entirely from the majority population, leading to an anomalously low genetic divergence on chromosome X between the hybrid population and one of the hybridizing populations, consistent with the pattern seen in humans and chimpanzees. This theoretical prediction might sound fanciful, but in fact it is borne out in hybrids of the western European and eastern European house mouse species in a band of territory that runs in a north-to-south direction through central Europe, roughly along the line of the former Cold War Iron Curtain. While the density of mutations separating the hybrid mice from western European mice is high in most of the genome because the hybrid mice carry DNA not just from western European mice but also from highly divergent eastern European mice, the density on the X chromosome is far less because the hybrid mice harbor very little DNA from the eastern European population whose X chromosomes are known to cause infertility in male hybrids.36",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,1146,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00
"The main counterargument to the Anatolian hypothesis is the steppe hypothesis—the idea that Indo-European languages spread from the steppe north of the Black and Caspian seas. The best single argument for the steppe hypothesis prior to the availability of genetic data may be the one constructed by David Anthony, who has shown that the shared vocabulary of the great majority of present-day Indo-European languages is unlikely to be consistent with their having originated much earlier than about six thousand years ago. His key observation is that all extant branches of the Indo-European language family except for the most anciently diverging Anatolian ones that are now extinct (such as ancient Hittite) have an elaborate shared vocabulary for wagons, including words for axle, harness pole, and wheels. Anthony interpreted this sharing as evidence that all Indo-European languages spoken today, from India in the east to the Atlantic fringe in the west, descend from a language spoken by an ancient population that used wagons. This population could not have lived much earlier than about six thousand years ago, since we know from archaeological evidence that it was around then that wheels and wagons spread.44 This date rules out the Anatolian farming expansion into Europe between nine thousand and eight thousand years ago. The obvious candidate for dispersing most of today’s Indo-European languages is thus the Yamnaya, who depended on the technology of wagons and wheels that became widespread around five thousand years ago.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,2283,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00
"A great lesson of the ancient DNA revolution is that its findings almost always provide accounts of human migrations that are very different from preexisting models, showing how little we really knew about human migrations and population formation prior to the invention of this new technology. The vision of Indo-Europeans or “Aryans” as a “pure” group has sparked nationalist sentiments in Europe since the nineteenth century.45 There were debates about whether the Celts or the Teutons or other groups were the real “Aryans,” and Nazi racism was fueled by this discussion. The genetic data have provided what might seem like uncomfortable support for some of these ideas—suggesting that a single, genetically coherent group was responsible for spreading many Indo-European languages. But the data also reveal that these early discussions were misguided in supposing purity of ancestry. Whether the original Indo-European speakers lived in the Near East or in eastern Europe, the Yamnaya, who were the main group responsible for spreading Indo-European languages across a vast span of the globe, were formed by mixture. The people who practiced the Corded Ware culture were a further mixture, and northwestern Europeans associated with the Bell Beaker culture were yet a further mixture. Ancient DNA has established major migration and mixture between highly divergent populations as a key force shaping human prehistory, and ideologies that seek a return to a mythical purity are flying in the face of hard science.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,2316,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00

"A second genetic revelation about Native American population history is clearest in the Chukchi, a population of far northeastern Siberia that speaks a language unrelated to any spoken in the Americas. My analyses revealed that the Chukchi harbor around 40 percent First American ancestry due to backflow from America to Asia.50 For those who are dubious about the idea that descendants of First Americans could have reexpanded out of America and then made a substantial demographic impact on Asia—who are used to thinking about the migratory path between Asia and America as a one-way street—it might be tempting to argue that the genetic affinity of the Chukchi to Native Americans simply reflects that they are the closest cousins of the First Americans in Asia. This bias also impeded my own thinking for more than a year as I tried to make sense of the data we had from diverse Native Americans. But the genetic data clarify that the affinity is due to back-migration, as the Chukchi are more closely related to some populations of entirely First American ancestry than to others, a finding that can only be explained if a sublineage of First Americans that originated well after the initial diversification of First American lineages in North America migrated back to Asia. The explanation for this observation is that the Eskimo-Aleut speakers who established themselves in North America mixed heavily with local Native Americans (who contributed about half their ancestry) and then took their successful way of life back through the Arctic with them to Siberia, contributing not only to the Chukchi but also to local speakers of Eskimo-Aleut languages.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,3336,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00

"The example of Cavalli-Sforza’s maps shows why his Sforza’s grand bet went sour. He was correct in his assumption that the present-day genetic structure of populations echoes some of the great events in the human past. For example, the lower genetic diversity of non-Africans compared to Africans reflects the reduced diversity of the modern human population that expanded out of Africa and the Near East after around fifty thousand years ago. But the present-day structure of human populations cannot recover the fine details of ancient events. The problem is not just that people have mixed with their neighbors, blurring the genetic signatures of past events. It is actually far more difficult, in that we now know, from ancient DNA, that the people who live in a particular place today almost never exclusively descend from the people who lived in the same place far in the past.9",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,269,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00
"Europe had reached a new equilibrium. The unmixed hunter-gatherers were disappearing, persisting only in isolated pockets like the islands off southern Sweden. In southeastern Europe, a settled farmer population had developed the most socially stratified societies known up until that time, and rituals that as the archaeologist Marija Gimbutas showed featured women in a central way—a far cry from the male-centered rituals that followed.17 In remote Britain, the megalith builders were hard at work on what developed into the greatest man-made monument the world had seen: the standing stones of Stonehenge, which became a national place of pilgrimage as reflected by goods brought from the far corners of Britain. People like those at Stonehenge were building great temples to their gods, and tombs for their dead, and could not have known that within a few hundred years their descendants would be gone and their lands overrun.

"But another possibility suggests itself, which is that the ancestral population of modern humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans actually lived in Eurasia, descending from the original Homo erectus spread out of Africa. In this scenario, there was later migration back from Eurasia to Africa, providing the primary founders of the population that later evolved into modern humans. The attraction of this theory is its economy: it requires one less major population movement between Africa and Eurasia to explain the data.

"a perennial debate among historians is the extent to which the human past is shaped by single individuals whose actions leave a disproportionate impact on subsequent generations. Star Cluster analysis provides objective information about the importance of extreme inequalities in power at different points in the past. Two studies, one led by Toomas Kivisild and the other led by Mark Stoneking, have compared the results of Star Cluster… ... In mitochondrial DNA data, all the studies found that most couples living in a population today have a very low probability of sharing a common ancestor along their entirely female line in the last ten thousand years, a period postdating the transition to agriculture in many parts of the world. This is exactly as expected if population sizes were large throughout this period. But on the Y chromosome, the studies found a pattern that was strikingly different. In East Asians, Europeans, Near Easterners, and North Africans, the authors found many Star Clusters with common male ancestors living roughly around five thousand years ago.18 The time around five thousand years ago coincides with the period in Eurasia that the archaeologist Andrew Sherratt called the “Secondary Products Revolution,” in which people began to find many uses for domesticated animals beyond meat production, including employing them to pull carts and plows and to produce dairy products and clothing such as wool.19 This was also around the time of the onset of the Bronze Age, a period of greatly increased human mobility and wealth accumulation, facilitated by the domestication of the horse, the invention of the wheel and wheeled vehicles, and the accumulation of rare metals like copper and tin, which are the ingredients of bronze and had to be imported from hundreds or even thousands of kilometers away. The Y-chromosome patterns reveal that this was also a time of greatly increased… ... Pääbo took seriously his moral responsibility as head of an ambitious German institute of anthropology, and wondered whether the truth about human population structure could be more like the anthropologist Frank Livingston’s suggestion that “there are no races, there are only clines”—a view in which human genetic variation is characterized by gradual geographic gradients that reflect interbreeding among neighbors.10 To explore this possibility, Pääbo investigated whether the clusters the Feldman study found appeared sharply defined because the analyzed populations had been sampled in a nonrandom fashion across the world. To understand how nonrandom sampling could contribute to this result, consider the United States, which harbors extraordinary diversity, but where genetic discontinuities among groups such as African Americans, European Americans, and East Asians are sharper than in the places from which immigrant populations came because the United States has drawn its immigrants from a subset of world locations. For example, in the United States, most of the African ancestry is from a handful of groups in West Africa,11 most of the European ancestry is from northwest Europe, and most of the Asian ancestry is from Northeast Asia. Pääbo showed that such nonrandom sampling could account for some of the effects Feldman and colleagues observed. However, later work proved that nonrandom sampling could not account for most of the structure, as substantial clustering of human populations is observed even when repeating analyses on geographically more evenly distributed sets of samples.12",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,4137,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00
"The great variability among males in the number of offspring produced means that by searching for genomic signatures of past variability in the number of children men have had, we can obtain genetic insights into the degree of social inequality in society as a whole, and not just between males and females. An extraordinary example of this is provided by the inequality in the number of male offspring that seems to have characterized the empire established by Genghis Khan, who ruled lands stretching from China to the Caspian Sea. ... A 2003 study led by Christopher Tyler-Smith showed how a relatively small number of powerful males living during the Mongol period succeeded in having an outsize impact on the billions of people living in East Eurasia today.15 His study of Y chromosomes suggested that one single male who lived around the time of the Mongols left many millions of direct male-line descendants across the territory that the Mongols occupied. The evidence is that about 8 percent of males in the lands that the Mongol Empire once occupied share a characteristic Y-chromosome sequence or one differing from it by just a few mutations.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,4112,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00
"People of West African ancestry today have a high rate of sickle cell disease, conferred by a mutation that changes the blood protein hemoglobin, the molecule that more than any other is responsible for ferrying oxygen around the body. This mutation has risen to substantial frequency under the pressure of natural selection in several places in Africa: in far West Africa (e.g., Senegal), in west-central Africa (e.g., Nigeria), and in central Africa (whence the mutation spread to eastern Africa and southern Africa via the migrations associated with the Bantu expansion). The reason this mutation has risen to such a high frequency in each of these populations is that if a person carries one copy of the mutation from either of his or her parents, it protects against the infectious disease malaria. Malaria is so dangerous that the protection provided to the approximately 20 percent of the population who carry one copy of the sickle cell mutation is balanced in evolutionary terms with the cost that the approximately 1 percent of the population has to pay in carrying two copies of the mutation and suffering from sickle cell disease, which kills in childhood without treatment. Strikingly, the mutation has arisen independently in each of three locations in Africa, which we know from the fact that the sequences on which it resides are all different. ... A similar pattern is seen for the mutations in the lactase gene that confer an ability to digest cow’s milk into adulthood.

"From a combination of archaeological and genetic data, we can be confident of at least four major population separations involving modern and archaic human lineages over the last two million years. The skeletal evidence shows that the first important spread of humans to Eurasia occurred at least 1.8 million years ago, bringing Homo erectus from Africa. The genetic evidence suggests that a second lineage split from the one leading to modern humans around 1.4 to 0.9 million years ago, giving rise to the superarchaic group that we have evidence of through its mixture with the ancestors of Denisovans and that plausibly contributed the highly divergent Denisovan mitochondrial DNA sequence that shares a common ancestor with both Neanderthals and modern humans in this time frame. Genetics also suggests a third major split 770,000 to 550,000 years ago when the ancestors of modern humans separated from Denisovans and Neanderthals, followed by Denisovans and Neanderthals from each other 470,000 to 380,000 years ago.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,1476,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00

"A major blow to the idea that Clovis groups were the first Americans came in 1997. That year marked the publication of the results of excavations at the site of Monte Verde in Chile, which contains butchered mastodon bones, wooden remains of structures, knotted string, ancient hearths, and stone tools with no stylistic similarities to the Clovis remains from North America.9 The radiocarbon dates of Monte Verde indicated that some of the artifacts there dated to around fourteen thousand years ago, definitively before the ice-free corridor had opened thousands of kilometers to the north. A group of skeptical archaeologists who had previously shot down many pre-Clovis claims visited the site that same year, and though they arrived doubting that the site could be that old, they left convinced. Their acceptance of Monte Verde was followed by the acceptance of finds elsewhere that also pointed to a pre-ice-free corridor and a pre-Clovis human presence in the Americas. Nearly as strong a case for a pre-ice-free corridor occupation has been made at the Paisley Caves in Oregon in the northwestern United States, where ancient feces in undisturbed soil layers have also been dated to around fourteen thousand years ago, and have yielded human mitochondrial DNA sequences.10",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,2891,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00

"I also highlight some of the great themes that are emerging, especially the finding that mixture between highly differentiated populations is a recurrent process in the human past. Today, many people assume that humans can be grouped biologically into “primeval” groups, corresponding to our notion of “races,” whose origins are populations that separated tens of thousands of years ago. But this long-held view about “race” has just in the last few years been proven wrong—and the critique of concepts of race that the new data provide is very different from the classic one that has been developed by anthropologists over the last hundred years. A great surprise that emerges from the genome revolution is that in the relatively recent past, human populations were just as different from each other as they are today, but that the fault lines across populations were almost unrecognizably different from today. DNA extracted from remains of people who lived, say, ten thousand years ago shows that the structure of human populations at that time was qualitatively different. Present-day populations are blends of past populations, which were blends themselves. The African American and Latino populations of the Americas are only the latest in a long line of major population mixtures.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,409,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00
"The high differentiation of human populations in the Near East ten thousand years ago was a specific instance of a broader pattern across the vast region of West Eurasia, documented by Iosif Lazaridis, who led the analysis. Analyzing our data, he found that about ten thousand years ago there were at least four major populations in West Eurasia—the farmers of the Fertile Crescent, the farmers of Iran, the hunter-gatherers of central and western Europe, and the hunter-gatherers of eastern Europe. All these populations differed from one another as much as Europeans differ from East Asians today. Scholars interested in trying to create ancestry-based racial classifications, had they lived ten thousand years ago, would have categorized these groups as “races,” even though none of these groups survives in unmixed form today. Spurred by the revolutionary technology of plant and animal domestication, which could support much higher population densities than hunting and gathering, the farmers of the Near East began migrating and mixing with their neighbors. But instead of one group displacing all the others and pushing them to extinction, as had occurred in some of the previous spreads of hunter-gatherers in Europe, in the Near East all the expanding groups contributed to later populations. The farmers in present-day Turkey expanded into Europe. The farmers in present-day Israel and Jordan expanded into East Africa, and their genetic legacy is greatest in present-day Ethiopia. Farmers related to those in present-day Iran expanded into India as well as the steppe north of the Black and Caspian seas. They mixed with local populations there and established new economies based on herding that allowed the agricultural revolution to spread into parts of the world inhospitable to domesticated crops. The different food-producing populations also mixed with one another, a process that was accelerated by technological developments in the Bronze Age after around five thousand years ago. This meant that the high genetic substructure that had previously characterized West Eurasia collapsed into the present-day very low level of genetic differentiation by the Bronze Age. It is an extraordinary example of how technology—in this case, domestication—contributed to homogenization, not just culturally but genetically. It shows that what is happening with the Industrial Revolution and the information revolution in our own time is not unique in the history of our species.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,1898,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00
"The first genome-wide ancient DNA data from Africa came from a forty-five-hundred-year-old skeleton found in a highland cave in Ethiopia.32 This ancient individual was much more closely related to one group living in Ethiopia today, the Ari, than to many others. Today there is an intricate caste system that shapes the lives of many people within Ethiopia, with elaborate rules preventing marriage between groups with different traditional roles.33 The Ari include three subgroups—the Cultivators, Blacksmiths, and Potters—who are socially and genetically differentiated from one another and from non-Ari groups.34 Since the Ari have a distinctive genetic affinity to the forty-five-hundred-year-old ancient highland individual compared to other Ethiopian groups, it is clear that there were strong local barriers to gene exchange and homogenization within the region of present-day Ethiopia that persisted for at least forty-five hundred years. This is the best example of strong endogamy that I know of—even more ancient than the evidence of endogamy in India that so far is only documented as going back a couple of thousand years.35",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,3905,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00
"For many tens of thousands of years, the Japanese archipelago was dominated by hunter-gatherers, but after around twenty-three hundred years ago, mainland-derived agriculture began to be practiced and was associated with an archaeological culture with clear similarities to contemporary cultures on the Korean peninsula. The genetic data confirm that the spread of farming to the islands was mediated by migration. Modeling present-day Japanese as a mixture of two anciently divergent populations of entirely East Asian origin—one related to present-day Koreans and one related to the Ainu who today are restricted to the northernmost Japanese island and whose DNA is similar to that of pre-farming hunter-gatherers37—Naruya Saitou and colleagues estimated that present-day Japanese have about 80 percent farmer and 20 percent hunter-gatherer ancestry. Relying on the sizes of segments of farmer-related ancestry in present-day Japanese, we and Saitou estimated the average date of mixture to be around sixteen hundred years ago.38 This date is far later than the first arrival of farmers to the region and suggests that after their arrival, it may have taken hundreds of years for social segregation between hunter-gatherers and farmers to break down. The date corresponds to the Kofun period, the first time when many Japanese islands were united under a single rule, perhaps marking the beginnings of the homogeneity that characterizes much of Japan today.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,3567,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00

"The fusion of these highly different populations into today’s West Eurasians is vividly evident in what might be considered the classic northern European look: blue eyes, light skin, and blond hair. Analysis of ancient DNA data shows that western European hunter-gatherers around eight thousand years ago had blue eyes but dark skin and dark hair, a combination that is rare today.33 The first farmers of Europe mostly had light skin but dark hair and brown eyes—thus light skin in Europe largely owes its origins to migrating farmers.34 The earliest known example of the classic European blond hair mutation is in an Ancient North Eurasian from the Lake Baikal region of eastern Siberia from seventeen thousand years ago.35 The hundreds of millions of copies of this mutation in central and western Europe today likely derive from a massive migration into the region of people bearing Ancient North Eurasian ancestry, an event that is related in the next chapter.36",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,1916,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00
"The rapid succession of lineage separations during the relatively short interval between Neanderthal and Denisovan interbreeding with modern humans suggests that throughout Eurasia, modern humans were moving into new environments where their technology or lifestyle allowed them to expand, displacing the previously resident groups. The spread was so fast that it is hard to imagine that archaic humans who had already been resident there for close to two million years, and who we know were also there when modern humans expanded based on the evidence of interbreeding with Denisovans, put up much resistance. Even if early modern humans expanded into East Asia via a Southern Route, they were likely also replaced by later waves of human migrants and can be ruled out as having contributed more than a very small percentage of the ancestry of present-day people.22 In East Asia as in West Eurasia, the expansion of modern humans out of Africa and the Near East had an effect akin to the erasing of a blackboard, creating a blank slate for the new people. The old populations of Eurasia collapsed, and in their place came new groups that swiftly inhabited the landscape. There is no genetic evidence of any substantial ancestry from these earlier populations in present East Asians.23",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,"Europeans split with Asians after neanderthal breeding, then Asians split with Australians, then Australian and denisovan breeding",yellow,,location,3453,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00

"What the data were showing us was that the genetic distinctions among jati groups within India were in many cases real, thanks to the long-standing history of endogamy in the subcontinent. People tend to think of India, with its more than 1.3 billion people, as having a tremendously large population, and indeed many Indians as well as foreigners see it this way. But genetically, this is an incorrect way to view the situation. The Han Chinese are truly a large population. They have been mixing freely for thousands of years. In contrast, there are few if any Indian groups that are demographically very large, and the degree of genetic differentiation among Indian jati groups living side by side in the same village is typically two to three times higher than the genetic differentiation between northern and southern Europeans.39 The truth is that India is composed of a large number of small populations.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,2717,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00
"Comparison of Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA types that are highly different in frequency between African Americans and Europeans also shows that by far the majority of the European ancestry in these populations comes from males, the result of social inequality in which mixed-race couplings were primarily between free males and female slaves.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,4084,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00
"While the genetic findings point to a central role for the Yamnaya in spreading Indo-European languages, tipping the scales definitively in favor of some variant of the steppe hypothesis, those findings do not yet resolve the question of the homeland of the original Indo-European languages, the place where these languages were spoken before the Yamnaya so dramatically expanded. Anatolian languages known from four-thousand-year-old tablets recovered from the Hittite Empire and neighboring ancient cultures did not share the full wagon and wheel vocabulary present in all Indo-European languages spoken today. Ancient DNA available from this time in Anatolia shows no evidence of steppe ancestry similar to that in the Yamnaya (although the evidence here is circumstantial as no ancient DNA from the Hittites themselves has yet been published). This suggests to me that the most likely location of the population that first spoke an Indo-European language was south of the Caucasus Mountains, perhaps in present-day Iran or Armenia, because ancient DNA from people who lived there matches what we would expect for a source population both for the Yamnaya and for ancient Anatolians. If this scenario is right, the population sent one branch up into the steppe—mixing with steppe hunter-gatherers in a one-to-one ratio to become the Yamnaya as described earlier—and another to Anatolia to found the ancestors of people there who spoke languages such as Hittite.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,2299,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00

"Evidence of sex bias in the mixture of human populations is becoming commonplace. The male-biased European contribution to admixed populations in the Americas is stark in African Americans, but it is truly extraordinary in populations in South and Central America, reflecting stories like that of Hernán Cortés and La Malinche. Andrés Ruiz-Linares and colleagues have documented how in the Antioquia region of Colombia, which was relatively isolated between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries, about 94 percent of the Y chromosomes are European in origin, whereas about 90 percent of the mitochondrial DNA sequences are of Native American origin.33 This reflects social selection against Native American men. Because nearly all the male ancestry comes from Europeans and nearly all the female ancestry comes from Native Americans, one might naively expect that the people of Antioquia today would derive about half their genome-wide ancestry from Europeans and half from Native Americans, but this is not the case. Instead, about 80 percent of Antioquian ancestry comes from Europeans.34 The explanation is that Antioquia was flooded by male migrants over many generations. The first European men to arrive mixed with Native American women. Additional European male migrants came later. Through repeated waves of male European migration, the proportion of European ancestry kept increasing everywhere in the genome except for mitochondrial DNA, because mitochondrial DNA is passed to the next generation entirely by females.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,4244,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00

"Our analysis of DNA from the Yamnaya—led by Iosif Lazaridis in my laboratory—showed that they harbored a combination of ancestries that did not previously exist in central Europe. The Yamnaya were the missing ingredient, carrying exactly the type of ancestry that needed to be added to early European farmers and hunter-gatherers to produce populations with the mixture of ancestries observed in Europe today.21 Our ancient DNA data also allowed us to learn how the Yamnaya themselves had formed from earlier populations. From seven thousand until five thousand years ago, we observed a steady influx into the steppe of a population whose ancestors traced their origin to the south—as it bore genetic affinity to ancient and present-day people of Armenia and Iran—eventually crystallizing in the Yamnaya, who were about a one-to-one ratio of ancestry from these two sources.22",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,2091,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00

"Remarkably, the patterns we observed were consistent with the hypothesis that all of the mixture of ANI and ASI ancestry that occurred in the history of some present-day Indian groups happened within the last four thousand years. This meant that the population structure of India before around four thousand years ago was profoundly different from what it is today. Before then, there were unmixed populations, but afterward, there was convulsive mixture in India, which affected nearly every group. So between four thousand and three thousand years ago—just as the Indus Civilization collapsed and the Rig Veda was composed—there was a profound mixture of populations that had previously been segregated. Today in India, people speaking different languages and coming from different social statuses have different proportions of ANI ancestry. Today, ANI ancestry in India derives more from males than from females. This pattern is exactly what one would expect from an Indo-European-speaking people taking the reins of political and social power after four thousand years ago and mixing with the local peoples in a stratified society, with males from the groups in power having more success in finding mates than those from the disenfranchised groups.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,2616,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00
"The most impressive example of the movements of farmers from the East Asian heartland to the periphery is the Austronesian expansion. Today, Austronesian languages are spread across a vast region including hundreds of remote Pacific islands. Archaeological, linguistic, and genetic data taken together have suggested that around five thousand years ago, mainland East Asian farming spread to Taiwan, where the deepest branches of the Austronesian language family are found. These farmers spread southward to the Philippines about four thousand years ago, and farther south around the large island of New Guinea and into the smaller islands to its east.43 At about the time they spread from Taiwan they probably invented outrigger canoes, boats with logs propped on the side that increase their stability in rough waters, making it possible to navigate the open seas. After thirty-three hundred years ago, ancient peoples making pottery in a style called Lapita appeared just to the east of New Guinea and soon afterward started expanding farther into the Pacific, quickly reaching Vanuatu three thousand kilometers from New Guinea. It took only a few hundred more years for them to spread through the western Polynesian islands including Tonga and Samoa, and then, after a long pause lasting until around twelve hundred years ago, they spread to the last habitable Pacific islands of New Zealand, Hawaii, and Easter Island by eight hundred years ago. The Austronesian expansion to the west was equally impressive, reaching Madagascar off the coast of Africa nine thousand kilometers to the west of the Philippines at least thirteen hundred years ago, and explaining why almost all Indonesians today as well as people from Madagascar speak Austronesian languages.44",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,3597,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00

"After the arrival of Europeans in the Americas in 1492, Native American populations and cultures collapsed under the pressure of European diseases, military campaigns, and an economic and political regime set on exploiting the riches of the continent and converting its inhabitants to Christianity. History is written by the victors, and the rewriting of the past after the European conquests has been particularly complete in the Americas, as there was no written language except in Mesoamerica prior to the arrival of Europeans. In Mexico, the Spanish burned indigenous books, and so most Native American writing literally went up in flames. The oral traditions suffered too. Language change, religious conversion, and discrimination against indigenous ways led Native American culture to be relegated to a lower status than European culture. Modern genomics offers an unexpected way to recover the past. African Americans—another population that has had its history stolen as its ancestors descend from people kidnapped into slavery from Africa—are at the forefront of trying to use genetics to trace roots. But if individual Native Americans often express a great interest in their genetic history, tribal councils have sometimes been hostile. A common concern is that genetic studies of Native American history are yet another example of Europeans trying to “enlighten” them. Past attempts to do so—for example, by conversion to Christianity or education in Western culture—have led to the dissolution of Native American culture. There is also an awareness that some scientists have studied Native Americans to learn about questions of interest primarily to non–Native Americans, without paying attention to the interests of Native Americans themselves.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,2924,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00
"Katarzyna Bryc, at the personal ancestry testing company 23andMe, worked with me to analyze more than five thousand self-described African Americans in the company database, and found that the average European ancestry proportion was 27 percent in most of the genome but only 23 percent on chromosome X.12 Comparing proportions of ancestry on chromosome X and the other chromosomes can provide information about differences in male and female behavior during population mixture, because two-thirds of X chromosomes in the world are carried in females compared to only about half of all other chromosomes, so the X chromosome is relatively more influenced by female history. By computing the proportion of European male and female ancestors that would be necessary to produce the observed difference in European ancestry between chromosome X and the autosomes, Bryc was able to estimate the separate male (38 percent) and female (10 percent) proportion of European ancestors in African Americans. These numbers imply that the contribution of European American men to the genetic makeup of the present-day African American population is about four times that of European American women. When I discussed these findings with the sociologist Orlando Patterson, he pointed out that the fraction of the European ancestry in African Americans that came from males—which if different from half is called “sex bias”—must have been far greater during the time of slavery. Since the civil rights movement in the United States in the mid-twentieth century, cultural changes have caused the sex bias to reverse, with more coupling between black men and white women. If we carried out DNA studies of African American skeletons from a hundred years ago, there is every reason to expect an even greater sex bias.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,4087,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00

The Population Y geographic distribution is largely limited to Amazonia, providing yet more evidence for an ancient origin. The fact that Population Y ancestry is restricted to difficult terrain far from the Bering link to Asia is perhaps what one would expect from an original pioneering population that was once more broadly distributed and was then marginalized by the expansion of other groups.

"Excitement about this bonanza was tempered by work led by Molly Przeworski, who studied the types of patterns that natural selection is likely to leave on the genome as a whole. A 2006 study by Przeworski and her colleagues showed that genome scans of present-day human genetic variation will miss most instances of natural selection because they simply will not have the statistical power needed to detect it, and that scans of this type will also have more power to detect some types of selection than others.31 A study she led in 2011 then showed that only a small fraction of evolution in humans has likely involved intense natural selection for advantageous mutations that had not previously been present in the population.32 Thus, intense and easily detectable episodes of natural selection such as those that have facilitated the digestion of cow’s milk into adulthood are an exception.33",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,741,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00

We discovered that the population of northern Europe was largely replaced by a mass migration from the eastern European steppe after five thousand years ago18; that farming developed in the Near East more than ten thousand years ago among multiple highly differentiated human populations that then expanded in all directions and mixed with each other along with the spread of agriculture19; and that the first human migrants into the remote Pacific islands beginning around three thousand years ago were not the sole ancestors of the present-day inhabitants.20,Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,360,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00
"What percentage of New Guinean genomes today derives from Denisovans?

"African genome sequences are typically about a third more diverse than non-African ones. Human diversity in Africa is extraordinary not only within but also across populations, as some pairs of African populations have been isolated for up to four times longer than any pairs of populations outside the continent, as reflected by the fact that for some pairs of populations—like San hunter-gatherers from southern Africa and Yoruba from West Africa—the minimum density of mutations separating their genomes is that much greater than that for any pair of genomes outside Africa.12 But learning about Africans’ deep past from today’s populations is extremely challenging because while much of the ancient variation still exists in people living today, it is all mixed up. The most recent mixing of populations occurred in the last few thousand years due to at least four great expansions, all of which are associated with the spread of language groups, and most of which have been driven by the spread of agriculturalists.13 These expansions have thrown a veil over the African past, moving populations thousands of kilometers from their places of origin, where they displaced or mixed with populations that were widespread before. In this respect, the study of African populations is no different from the study of Eurasian ones, which have also turned over in the last several thousand years.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,3788,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00
"A 2011 paper by Heng Li and Richard Durbin showed that the idea that a single person’s genome contains information about a multitude of ancestors was not just a theoretical possibility, but a reality. To decipher the deep history of a population from a single person’s DNA, Li and Durbin leveraged the fact that any single person actually carries not one but two genomes: one from his or her father and one from his or her mother.24 Thus it is possible to count the number of mutations separating the genome a person receives from his or her mother and the genome the person receives from his or her father to determine when they shared a common ancestor at each location. By examining the range of dates when these ancestors lived—plotting the ages of one hundred thousand Adams and Eves—Li and Durbin established the size of the ancestral population at different times. In a small population, there is a substantial chance that two randomly chosen genome sequences derive from the same parent genome sequence, because the individuals who carry them share a parent. However, in a large population the chance is far lower. Thus, the times in the past when the population size was low can be identified based on the periods in the past when a disproportionate fraction of lineages have evidence of sharing common ancestors. Walt Whitman, in the poem “Song of Myself,” wrote, “Do I contradict myself? / Very well, then I contradict myself, / (I am large, I contain multitudes).” Whitman could just as well have been talking about the Li and Durbin experiment and its demonstration that a whole population history is contained within a single person as revealed by the multitude of ancestors whose histories are recorded within that person’s genome.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,677,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00
"One of the most striking genomic discoveries of the past few years is a mutation in a gene that is active in red blood cells and that allows people who live in high-altitude Tibet to thrive in their oxygen-poor environment. Rasmus Nielsen and colleagues have shown that the segment of DNA on which this mutation occurs matches much more closely to the Siberian Denisovan genome than to DNA from Neanderthals or present-day Africans.21 This suggests that some Denisovan relatives in mainland Asia may have harbored an adaptation to high altitude, which the ancestors of Tibetans inherited through Denisovan interbreeding. Archaeological evidence shows that the first inhabitants of the Tibetan high plateau began living there seasonally after eleven thousand years ago, and that permanent occupation based on agriculture began around thirty-six hundred years ago.22 It is likely that the mutation increased rapidly in frequency only after these dates, a prediction that will be possible to test directly through DNA studies of ancient Tibetans. Interbreeding with Neanderthals helped modern humans to adapt to new environments just as interbreeding with Denisovans did. We and others showed that at genes associated with the biology of keratin proteins, present-day Europeans and East Asians have inherited much more Neanderthal ancestry on average than is the case for most other groups of genes.23 This suggests that versions of keratin biology genes carried by Neanderthals were preserved in non-Africans by the pressures of natural selection, perhaps because keratin is an essential ingredient of skin and hair, which are important for providing protection from the elements in cold environments such as the ones that modern humans were moving into and to which Neanderthals were already adapted.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,1439,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00

"This Yamnaya expansion also cannot have been entirely friendly, as is clear from the fact that the proportion of Y chromosomes of steppe origin in both western Europe26 and in India27 today is much larger than the proportion of steppe ancestry in the rest of the genome. This preponderance of male ancestry coming from the steppe implies that male descendants of the Yamnaya with political or social power were more successful at competing for local mates than men from the local groups. The most striking example I know of is from Iberia in far southwestern Europe, where Yamnaya-derived ancestry arrived at the onset of the Bronze Age between forty-five hundred and four thousand years ago. Daniel Bradley’s laboratory and my laboratory independently produced ancient DNA from individuals of this period.28 We found that approximately 30 percent of the Iberian population was replaced along with the arrival of steppe ancestry. However, the replacement of Y chromosomes was much more dramatic: in our data around 90 percent of males who carry Yamnaya ancestry have a Y-chromosome type of steppe origin that was absent in Iberia prior to that time. It is clear that there were extraordinary hierarchies and imbalances in power at work in the expansions from the steppe.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,4189,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00

"But Excoffier got something important right. This became evident when we and others analyzed the bits of Neanderthal DNA that entered into the modern human population and mapped their positions in the genome. To do this, Sriram Sankararaman in my laboratory searched for mutations that were present in the sequenced Neanderthals but were rare or absent in sub-Saharan Africans. By studying stretches of such mutations, we were able to find a substantial fraction of all the Neanderthal ancestry fragments in each non-African. Looking at where in the genome these Neanderthal ancestry fragments occurred, it became clear that the impact of Neanderthal interbreeding varied dramatically across the genome of non-African people today. The average proportion of Neanderthal ancestry in non-African populations is around 2 percent, but it is not spread evenly. In more than half the genome, no Neanderthal ancestry has been detected in anyone. But in some unusual places in the genome, more than 50 percent of DNA sequences are from Neanderthals.32 A critical clue that helped us to understand how this pattern had formed came from studying the places in non-African genomes where Neanderthal ancestry is rare. In any one stretch of DNA, an absence of Neanderthal ancestry in the population can happen by chance, as we think is the case for mitochondrial DNA. However, it is improbable that a substantial subset of the genome with particular biological functions will be systematically depleted of Neanderthal ancestry unless natural selection systematically worked to remove it. But evidence of systematic removal of Neanderthal ancestry is exactly what we found—and, remarkably, we found a particularly intense depletion of Neanderthal ancestry by natural selection in two parts of the genome known to be relevant to the fertility of hybrids.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,1120,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00
"While the interbreeding Neanderthals were close relatives of those we obtained samples from and sequenced, the archaic people who interbred with the ancestors of New Guineans were not close relatives of the Siberian Denisovans. When we examined the genomes of present-day New Guineans and Australians, and counted the number of DNA letter differences between them and the Siberian Denisovans to estimate when their ancestors separated from a common parent population, we discovered that everywhere in the genome, the number of differences was at least what would be expected for a population split that occurred 400,000 to 280,000 years ago.13 This meant that the ancestors of the Siberian Denisovans separated from the Denisovan lineage that contributed ancestry to New Guineans two-thirds of the way back to the separation of the ancestors of Denisovans from Neanderthals. In light of the remote relationship, the two groups probably had different adaptations, which would explain how they were able to thrive in such different climates. Given the extraordinary diversity of Denisovans—with much more time separation among their populations than exists among present-day groups—it makes sense to think of them as a broad category of humans, one branch of which became the ancestors of the archaic population that interbred with New Guineans and another that became Siberian Denisovans. Most likely there are other Denisovan populations as well that we haven’t sampled at all. Maybe we should even consider Neanderthals as part of this broad Denisovan family.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,1387,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00
"Denisovans were genetically a little closer to New Guineans than they were to any population from mainland Eurasia, suggesting that New Guinean ancestors had interbred with Denisovans. Yet the distance from Denisova Cave to New Guinea is around nine thousand kilometers, and New Guinea is, of course, separated by sea from the Asian mainland. The climate in New Guinea is also largely tropical, which could not be more different from Siberia’s bitter winters, and this makes it unlikely that archaic humans adapted to one environment would have flourished in the other.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,1313,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00

"An unanticipated finding of the Li and Durbin study was its evidence that after the separation of non-African and African populations, there was an extended period in the shared history of non-Africans when populations were small, as reflected in evidence for many shared ancestors spread over tens of thousands of years.25 A shared “bottleneck event” among non-Africans—when a small number of ancestors gave rise to a large number of descendants today—was not a new finding. But prior to Li and Durbin’s work, there was no good information about the duration of this event, and it seemed plausible that it could have transpired over just a few generations—for example, a small band of people crossing the Sahara into North Africa, or from Africa into Asia. The Li and Durbin evidence of an extended period of small population size was also hard to square with the idea of an unstoppable expansion of modern humans both within and outside Africa around fifty thousand years ago. Our history may not be as simple as the story of a dominant group that was immediately successful wherever it went.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,690,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00
"It is tempting to think that the Australo-Denisovans, Denisovans, and Neanderthals descend from the first Homo erectus populations that expanded out of Africa, and that modern humans descend from the Homo erectus populations that stayed in Africa, but that would be wrong. The oldest Homo erectus skeletons outside of Africa have been found at the site of Dmanisi in Georgia dating to around 1.8 million years ago, and on the island of Java in Indonesia dating to almost the same time. If Homo erectus from the first radiation out of Africa was ancestral to the Denisovans and Neanderthals, then the split of these populations from modern humans would be at least as old as the dispersal to Eurasia—far too old to be consistent with the genetic observations. The genetic data give a split date of 770,000 to 550,000 years ago, too recent to be consistent with a 1.8-million-year-old population separation. There is, however, a candidate in the fossil record for an ancestor in the right period, dating to long after the Homo erectus out-of-Africa migration but after the Homo sapiens one. A big-skulled skeleton found near Heidelberg in Germany in 1907 and dated to around six hundred thousand years ago15 was plausibly from a species that was ancestral to modern humans and Neanderthals,16 and by implication, Denisovans too. Homo heidelbergensis is often viewed as both a West Eurasian and an African species, but not an East Eurasian species. However, the genetic evidence from the Australo-Denisovans shows that the Homo heidelbergensis lineage may have been established very anciently in East Eurasia too. One of the profound implications of the Denisovan discovery was that East Eurasia is a central stage of human evolution and not a sideshow as westerners often assume.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,1404,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00
"There is a limit, though, to the information that comparison of genome sequences provides about deep time. At each place in the genome, if we trace back our lineages far enough into the past, we reach a point where everyone descends from the same ancestor, beyond which it becomes impossible to obtain any information about deeper time from comparison of the DNA sequences of people living today. From this perspective, the common ancestor at each point in the genome is like a black hole in astrophysics, from which no information about deeper time can escape. For mitochondrial DNA this black hole occurs around 160,000 years ago, the date of “Mitochondrial Eve.” For the great majority of the rest of the genome the black hole occurs between five million and one million years ago, and thus the rest of the genome can provide information about far deeper time than is accessible through analysis of mitochondrial DNA.22 Beyond this, everything goes dark.",Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past,David Reich,B073NP8WT3,,yellow,,location,652,2018-06-07 04:56:00+00:00

But the technological revolution that took place in Silicon valley put traditional companies under financial threat. For instance, after the rise of Microsoft and the personal computer, IBM, which was the main farm for company men, had to lay off a proportion of its “lifers,” who then realized that the low-risk profile of their position wasn’t so low risk. These people couldn’t find a job elsewhere; they were of no use to anyone outside IBM. Even their sense of humor failed outside of the corporate culture. If the company man is, sort of, gone, he has been replaced by the companies person. For people are no longer owned by a company but by something worse: the idea that they need to be employable.

"Leviticus is a sweetening of Hammurabi’s rule. The Golden Rule wants you to Treat others the way you would like them to treat you. The more robust Silver Rule says Do not treat others the way you would not like them to treat you. More robust? How? Why is the Silver Rule more robust? First, it tells you to mind your own business and not decide what is “good” for others. We know with much more clarity what is bad than what is good. The Silver Rule can be seen as the Negative Golden Rule, and as I am shown by my Calabrese (and Calabrese-speaking) barber every three weeks, via negativa (acting by removing) is more powerful and less error-prone than via positiva (acting by addition*1). Now a word about the “others” in treat others. “You” can be singular or plural, hence it can designate an individual, a basketball team, or the Northeast Association of Calabrese-Speaking Barbers. Same with the “others.” The idea is fractal, in the sense that it works at all scales: humans, tribes, societies, groups of societies, countries, etc., assuming each one is a separate standalone unit and can deal with other counterparts as such. Just as individuals should treat others the way they would like to be treated (or avoid being mistreated), families as units should treat other families in the same way. And, something that makes the interventionistas of Prologue 1 even more distasteful, so should countries. For Isocrates, the wise Athenian orator, warned us as early as the fifth century B.C. that nations should treat other nations according to the Silver Rule. He wrote: “Deal with weaker states as you think it appropriate for stronger states to deal with you.”",Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life,Nassim Nicholas Taleb,B075HYVP7C,,yellow,,location,360,2018-06-19 04:56:00+00:00

"So employees exist because they have significant skin in the game—and the risk is shared with them, enough risk for it to be a deterrent and a penalty for acts of undependability, such as failing to show up on time. You are buying dependability. And dependability is a driver behind many transactions. People of some means have a country house—which is inefficient compared to hotels or rentals—because they want to make sure it is available if they decide they want to use it on a whim. There is a trader’s expression: “Never buy when you can rent the three Fs: what you Float, what you Fly, and what you…(that something else).” Yet many people own boats and planes, and end up stuck with that something else. True, a contractor has downside, a financial penalty that can be built into the contract, in addition to reputational costs. But consider that an employee will always have more risk. And conditional on someone being an employee, such a person will be risk averse. By being employees they signal a certain type of domestication. Someone who has been employed for a while is giving you strong evidence of submission. Evidence of submission is displayed by the employee’s going through years depriving himself of his personal freedom for nine hours every day, his ritualistic and punctual arrival at an office, his denying himself his own schedule, and his not having beaten up anyone on the way back home after a bad day.

"Some think that freeing ourselves from having warriors at the top means civilization and progress. It does not. Meanwhile, Bureaucracy is a construction by which a person is conveniently separated from the consequences of his or her actions. And, one may ask, what can we do since a centralized system will necessarily need people who are not directly exposed to the cost of errors? Well, we have no choice but to decentralize or, more politely, to localize; to have fewer of these immune decision makers. Decentralization is based on the simple notion that it is easier to macrobull***t than microbull***t. Decentralization reduces large structural asymmetries. But not to worry, if we do not decentralize and distribute responsibility, it will happen by itself, the hard way: a system that doesn’t have a mechanism of skin in the game, with a buildup of imbalances, will eventually blow up and self-repair that way.

When I saw Donald Trump in the Republican primary standing next to other candidates, I became certain he was going to win that stage of the process, no matter what he said or did. Actually, it was because he had visible deficiencies. Why? Because he was real, and the public—composed of people who usually take risks, not the lifeless non-risk-taking analysts we will present in the next chapter—would vote anytime for someone who actually bled after putting an icepick in his hand rather than someone who did not. Arguments that Trump was a failed entrepreneur, even if true, actually prop up this argument: you’d even rather have a failed real person than a successful one, as blemishes, scars, and character flaws increase the distance between a human and a ghost.*2 Scars signal skin in the game.

"The flaw in psychology papers is to believe that the subject doesn’t take any other tail risks anywhere outside the experiment and, crucially, will never again take any risk at all. The idea in social science of “loss aversion” has not been thought through properly—it is not measurable the way it has been measured (if it is at all measurable). Say you ask a subject how much he would pay to insure a 1 percent probability of losing $100. You are trying to figure out how much he is “overpaying” for “risk aversion” or something even more foolish, “loss aversion.” But you cannot possibly ignore all the other financial risks he is taking: if he has a car parked outside that can be scratched, if he has a financial portfolio that can lose money, if he has a bakery that may risk a fine, if he has a child in college who may cost unexpectedly more, if he can be laid off, if he may be unexpectedly ill in the future. All these risks add up, and the attitude of the subject reflects them all.

"TAKE RISK Finally, when young people who “want to help mankind” come to me asking, “What should I do? I want to reduce poverty, save the world,” and similar noble aspirations at the macro-level, my suggestion is: 1) Never engage in virtue signaling; 2) Never engage in rent-seeking; 3) You must start a business. Put yourself on the line, start a business. Yes, take risk, and if you get rich (which is optional), spend your money generously on others. We need people to take (bounded) risks. The entire idea is to move the descendants of Homo sapiens away from the macro, away from abstract universal aims, away from the kind of social engineering that brings tail risks to society. Doing business will always help (because it brings about economic activity without large-scale risky changes in the economy); institutions (like the aid industry) may help, but they are equally likely to harm (I am being optimistic; I am certain that except for a few most do end up harming).

"I will propose that what people resent—or should resent—is the person at the top who has no skin in the game, that is, because he doesn’t bear his allotted risk, he is immune to the possibility of falling from his pedestal, exiting his income or wealth bracket, and waiting in line outside the soup kitchen. Again, on that account, the detractors of Donald Trump, when he was still a candidate, not only misunderstood the value of scars as risk signaling, but they also failed to realize that, by advertising his episode of bankruptcy and his personal losses of close to a billion dollars, he removed the resentment (the second type of inequality) people may have had toward him. There is something respectable in losing a billion dollars, provided it is your own money. In addition, someone without skin in the game—say, a corporate executive with upside and no financial downside (the type to speak clearly in meetings)—is paid according to some metrics that do not necessarily reflect the health of his company; these he can manipulate, hide risks, get the bonus, then retire (or go do the same thing at another company) and blame his successor for subsequent results. We will also, in the process, redefine inequality and put the notion on more rigorous grounds. But we first need to introduce the difference between two types of approaches, the static and the dynamic, as skin in the game can transform one type of inequality into another.

In other words, you do not need science to survive (we’ve survived for several hundred million years or more, depending on how you define the “we”), but you must survive to do science. As your grandmother would have said, better safe than sorry. Or as per the expression attributed to Hobbes: Primum vivere, deinde philosophari (First, live; then philosophize).

"An expert rule in my business is to never hire a well-dressed trader. But it goes beyond: Hire the successful trader, conditional on a solid track record, whose details you can understand the least. Not the most: the least. Why so? I’ve introduced this point in Antifragile, where I called it the green lumber fallacy. A fellow made a fortune in green lumber without knowing what appears to be essential details about the product he traded—he wasn’t aware that green lumber stood for freshly cut wood, not lumber that was painted green. Meanwhile, by contrast, the person who related the story went bankrupt while knowing every intimate detail about the green lumber. The fallacy is that what one may need to know in the real world does not necessarily match what one can perceive through intellect: it doesn’t mean that details are not relevant, only that those we tend (IYI-style) to believe are important can distract us from more central attributes of the price mechanism.

I have a finite shelf life, humanity should have an infinite duration. Or, I am renewable, not humanity or the ecosystem. Even worse, as I have shown in Antifragile, the fragility of the system’s components (provided they are renewable and replaceable) is required to ensure the solidity of the system as a whole.

"Let us return to Warren Buffett. He did not make his billions by cost-benefit analysis; rather, he did so simply by establishing a high filter, then picking opportunities that pass such a threshold. “The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything,” he said. Likewise our wiring might be adapted to “say no” to tail risk. For there are a zillion ways to make money without taking tail risk. There are a zillion ways to solve problems (say, feed the world) without complicated technologies that entail fragility and an unknown possibility of tail blowup.

"Now let us get deeper into the application of the Silver Rule in intellectual debates. You can criticize either what a person said or what a person meant. The former is more sensational, hence lends itself more readily to dissemination. The mark of a charlatan—say the writer and pseudo-rationalist Sam Harris—is to defend his position or attack a critic by focusing on some specific statement (“look at what he said”) rather than blasting his exact position (“look at what he means” or, more broadly, “look at what he stands for”)—for the latter requires an extensive grasp of the proposed idea. Note that the same applies to the interpretation of religious texts, often extracted from their broader circumstances. It is impossible for anyone to write a perfectly rationally argued document without a segment that, out of context, can be transformed by some dishonest copywriter to appear totally absurd and lend itself to sensationalization, so politicians, charlatans, and, more disturbingly, journalists hunt for these segments. “Give me a few lines written by any man and I will find enough to get him hung” goes the saying attributed to Richelieu, Voltaire, Talleyrand, a vicious censor during the French revolution phase of terror, and a few others.

"Mediterranean societies are traditionally ones in which the highest-ranking person is the one with the most skin in the game. And if anything characterizes today’s America, it is economic risk taking, thanks to a happy transfer of martial values to business and commerce in Anglo-Saxon society—remarkably, traditional Arabic culture also puts the same emphasis on the honor of economic risk-taking. But history shows that there were—and still are—societies in which the intellectual was at the top. The Hindus held the Brahman to be first in the hierarchy, the Celts had the druids (so do their Druze possible-cousins), the Egyptians had their scribes, and the Chinese had for a relatively brief time the scholar. Let me add postwar France. You can notice a remarkable similarity to the way these intellectuals held power and separated themselves from the rest: through complex, extremely elaborate rituals, mysteries that stay within the caste, and an overriding focus on the cosmetic. Even within the “normal” warrior-run or doer-run societies, the class of intellectuals is all about rituals: without pomp and ceremony, the intellectual is just a talker, that is, pretty much nothing. Consider the bishop in my parts, the Greek-Orthodox church: it’s a show of dignity. A bishop on rollerblades would no longer be a bishop.

Yet one of the most cited ideas in history, that of the invisible hand, appears to be the least integrated into modern psyche.

"There are two ways to make citizens safe from large predators, say, big powerful corporations. The first one is to enact regulations—but these, aside from restricting individual freedoms, lead to another predation, this time by the state, its agents, and their cronies. More critically, people with good lawyers can game regulations (or, as we will see, make it known that they hire former regulators, and overpay for them, which signals a prospective bribe to those currently in office). And of course regulations, once in, stay in, and even when they are proven absurd, politicians are afraid of repealing them, under pressure from those benefiting from them. Given that regulations are additive, we soon end up tangled in complicated rules that choke enterprise. They also choke life. For there are always parasites benefiting from regulation, situations where the businessperson uses government to derive profits, often through protective regulations and franchises. The mechanism is called regulatory recapture, as it cancels the effect of what a regulation was meant to do. The other solution is to put skin in the game in transactions, in the form of legal liability, and the possibility of an efficient lawsuit. The Anglo-Saxon world has traditionally had a predilection for the legal approach instead of the regulatory one: if you harm me, I can sue you. This has led to the very sophisticated, adaptive, and balanced common law, built bottom-up, via trial and error. When people transact, they almost always prefer to agree (as part of the contract) on a Commonwealth (or formerly British-ruled) venue as a forum in the event of a dispute: Hong Kong and Singapore are the favorites in Asia, London and New York in the West.

"The researchers Gerd Gigerenzer and Henry Brighton contrast the approaches of the “rationalistic” school (in quotation marks, as there is little that is rational in these rationalists) and that of the heuristic one, in the following example on how a baseball player catches the ball by Richard Dawkins: Richard Dawkins (…) argues that “He behaves as if he had solved a set of differential equations in predicting the trajectory of the ball. At some subconscious level, something functionally equivalent to the mathematical calculations is going on.” (…) Instead, experiments have shown that players rely on several heuristics. The gaze heuristic is the simplest one and works if the ball is already high up in the air: Fix your gaze on the ball, start running, and adjust your running speed so that the angle of gaze remains constant. This error by the science writer Richard Dawkins generalizes to, simply, overintellectualizing humans in their responses to all manner of natural phenomena, rather than accepting the role of a collection of mental heuristics used for specific purposes. The baseball player has no clue about the exact heuristic, but he goes with it—otherwise he would lose the game to another, nonintellectualizing, competitor. Likewise, as we will see in Chapter 18, religious “beliefs” are simply mental heuristics that solve a collection of problems—without the agent really knowing how. Solving equations in order to make a decision isn’t a skill we humans can aspire to have—it is computationally impossible.

It exists at the intersection of Greco-Roman law (as reflected from people in Semitic territories’ contact with the school of law of Berytus), Phoenician trading rules, Babylonian legislations, and Arab tribal commercial customs and, as such, it provides a repository of ancient Mediterranean and Semitic lore. I hence view Sharia as a museum of the history of ideas on symmetry in transactions. Sharia establishes the interdict of gharar, drastic enough to be totally banned in any form of transaction. It is an extremely sophisticated term in decision theory that does not exist in English; it means both uncertainty and deception—my personal take is that it means something beyond informational asymmetry between agents: inequality of uncertainty.

"TALKING ONE’S BOOK I went on television once to announce a newly published book and got stuck in the studio, drafted to become part of a roundtable with two journalists plus the anchor. The topic of the day was Microsoft, a company that was in existence at the time. Everyone, including the anchor, chipped in. My turn came: “I own no Microsoft stock, I am short no Microsoft stock [i.e., would benefit from its decline], hence I can’t talk about it.” I repeated my dictum of Prologue 1: Don’t tell me what you think, tell me what you have in your portfolio. There was immeasurable confusion in the faces: a journalist is typically not supposed to talk about stocks he owns—and, what is worse, is supposed to always, always make pronouncements about stuff he can barely find on a map. A journalist is meant to be an impartial “judge,” yet, unlike Sisamnes in the Judgment of Cambyses, there is no threat of a secondary use of his skin. There are two types of “talking one’s book.” One consists of buying a stock because you like it, then commenting on it (and disclosing such ownership)—the most reliable advocate for a product is its user.*6 Another is buying a stock so you can advertise the qualities of the company, then selling it, benefiting from the trumpeting—this is called market manipulation, and it is certainly a conflict of interest. We removed the skin in the game of journalists in order to prevent market manipulation, thinking that it would be a net gain to society. The arguments in this book are that the former (market manipulation) and conflicts of interest are more benign than impunity for bad advice. The main reason, we will see, is that in the absence of skin in the game, journalists will imitate, to be safe, the opinion of other journalists, thus creating monoculture and collective mirages.*7",Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life,Nassim Nicholas Taleb,B075HYVP7C,,yellow,,location,1102,2018-06-19 04:56:00+00:00

In science, belief is literal belief; it is right or wrong, never metaphorical. In real life, belief is an instrument to do things, not the end product. This is similar to vision: the purpose of your eyes is to orient you in the best possible way, and get you out of trouble when needed, or help you find prey at a distance.

"Karl Popper’s idea of science is an enterprise that produces claims that can be contradicted by eventual observations, not a series of verifiable ones: science is fundamentally disconfirmatory, not confirmatory. This mechanism of falsification is entirely Lindy-compatible; it actually requires the operation of the Lindy effect (in combination with the minority rule). Although Popper saw the statics, he didn’t study the dynamics, nor did he look at the risk dimension of things. The reason science works isn’t because there is a proper “scientific method” derived by some nerds in isolation, or some “standard” that passes a test similar to the eye exam of the Department of Motor Vehicles; rather it is because scientific ideas are Lindy-prone, that is, subjected to their own natural fragility. Ideas need to have skin in the game. You know an idea will fail if it is not useful, and can be therefore vulnerable to the falsification of time (and not that of naive falsificationism, that is, according to some government-printed black-and-white guideline). The longer an idea has been around without being falsified, the longer its future life expectancy. For if you read Paul Feyerabend’s account of the history of scientific discoveries, you can clearly see that anything goes in the process—but not with the test of time. That appears to be nonnegotiable. Note that I am here modifying Popper’s idea; we can replace “true” (rather, not false) with “useful,” even “not harmful,” even “protective to its users.” So I will diverge from Popper in the following. For things to survive, they necessarily need to fare well in the risk dimension, that is, be good at not dying. By the Lindy effect, if an idea has skin in the game, it is not in the truth game, but in the harm game. An idea survives if it is a good risk manager, that is, not only doesn’t harm its holders, but favors their survival—this also applies to superstitions that have crossed centuries because they led to some protective actions.

"Same with real estate: most people, I am convinced, are happier in close quarters, in a real barrio-style neighborhood, where they can feel human warmth and company. But when they have big bucks they end up pressured to move into outsized, impersonal, and silent mansions, far away from neighbors. On late afternoons, the silence of these large galleries has a funereal feel to it, but without the soothing music. This is something historically rare: in the past, large mansions were teeming with servants, head-servants, butlers, cooks, assistants, maids, private tutors, impoverished cousins, horse grooms, even personal musicians.

"Anyone who has survived in the risk-taking business more than a few years has some version of our by now familiar principle that “in order to succeed, you must first survive.” My own has been: “never cross a river if it is on average four feet deep.” I effectively organized all my life around the point that sequence matters and the presence of ruin disqualifies cost-benefit analyses; but it never hit me that the flaw in decision theory was so deep. Until out of nowhere came a paper by the physicist Ole Peters, working with the great Murray Gell-Mann. They presented a version of the difference between ensemble and time probabilities with a thought experiment similar to mine above, and showed that just about everything in social science having to do with probability is flawed. Deeply flawed. Very deeply flawed. Largely, terminally flawed. For, in the quarter millennia since an initial formulation of decision making under uncertainty by the mathematician Jacob Bernoulli, one that has since become standard, almost all people involved in the field have made the severe mistake of missing the effect of the difference between ensemble and time.*1 Everyone? Not quite: every economist maybe, but not everyone: the applied mathematicians Claude Shannon and Ed Thorp, and the physicist J. L. Kelly of the Kelly Criterion got it right.

"Looking at genetic data in the Eastern Mediterranean with my collaborator the geneticist Pierre Zalloua, we noticed that both invaders, Turks and Arabs, left few genes, and in the case of Turkey, the tribes from East and Central Asia brought an entirely new language. Turkey, shockingly, is still inhabited by the populations of Asia Minor you read about in history books, but with new names. Further, Zalloua and his colleagues claim that Canaanites from 3,700 years ago represent more than nine-tenths of the genes of current residents of the state of Lebanon, with only a tiny amount of new genes added, in spite of about every possible army having dropped by for sightseeing and some pillaging.*2 While Turks are Mediterraneans who speak an East Asian language, the French (North of Avignon) are largely of Northern European stock, yet they speak a Mediterranean language. So: Genes follow majority rule; languages minority rule. Languages travel; genes less so. This shows us the recent mistake of building racial theories on language, dividing people into “Aryans” and “Semites,” based on linguistic considerations. While the subject was central to the German Nazis, the practice continues today in one form or another, often benign. For the great irony is that Northern European supremacists (“Aryan”), while anti-Semitic, used the classical Greeks to give themselves a pedigree and a link to a glorious civilization, but didn’t realize that the Greeks and their Mediterranean “Semitic” neighbors were actually genetically close to one another.

"So it appears that the church founders really wanted Christ to have skin in the game; he did actually suffer on the cross, sacrifice himself, and experience death. He was a risk taker. More crucially to our story, he sacrificed himself for the sake of others. A god stripped of humanity cannot have skin in the game in such a manner, cannot really suffer (or, if he does, such a redefinition of a god injected with a human nature would back up our argument). A god who didn’t really suffer on the cross would be like a magician who performed an illusion, not someone who actually bled after sliding an icepick between his carpal bones. The Orthodox Church goes further, making the human side flow upward rather than downward. The fourth-century bishop Athanasius of Alexandria wrote: “Jesus Christ was incarnate so we could be made God” (emphasis mine). It is the very human character of Jesus that can allow us mortals to access God and merge with him, become part of him, in order to partake of the divine. That fusion is called theosis.

"Aside from his theorem, Coase was the first to shed light on why firms exist. For him, contracts can be too costly to negotiate due to transaction costs; the solution is to incorporate your business and hire employees with clear job descriptions because you can’t afford legal and organizational bills for every transaction. A free market is a place where forces act to determine specialization, and information travels via price point; but within a firm these market forces are lifted because they cost more to run than the benefits they bring. So market forces will cause the firm to aim for the optimal ratio of employees and outside contractors. As we can see, Coase stopped one or two inches short of the notion of skin in the game. He never thought in risk terms to realize that an employee is also a risk-management strategy. Had economists, Coase or Shmoase, had any interest in the ancients, they would have discovered the risk-management strategy relied upon by Roman families who customarily had a slave for treasurer, the person responsible for the finances of the household and the estate. Why? Because you can inflict a much higher punishment on a slave than a free person or a freedman—and you do not need to rely on the mechanism of the law for that. You can be bankrupted by an irresponsible or dishonest steward who can divert your estate’s funds to Bithynia.

"In fact, what Captain Mark Weisenborn, Pasquale Cirillo, and I discovered, when we tried doing a systematic study of violence (debunking the confabulatory thesis by Steven Pinker that we mentioned earlier, holding that violence has dropped), was that war numbers have been historically inflated…by both sides. Both the Mongols (during their sweep across Eurasia in the Middle Ages) and their panicky victims had an incentive to exaggerate, which acted as a deterrent. Mongols weren’t interested in killing everybody; they just wanted submission, which came cheaply through terror. Further, having spent some time perusing the genetic imprints of invaded populations, it is clear that if the warriors coming from the Eastern steppes left a cultural imprint, they certainly left their genes at home.

"Another common error in the psychology literature concerns what is called “mental accounting.” The Thorp, Kelly, and Shannon school of information theory requires that, for an investment strategy to be ergodic and eventually capture the return of the market, agents increase their risks as they are winning, but contract after losses, a technique called “playing with the house money.” In practice, it is done by threshold, for ease of execution, not complicated rules: you start betting aggressively whenever you have a profit, never when you have a deficit, as if a switch was turned on or off. This method is practiced by probably every single trader who has survived. Now it happens that this dynamic strategy is deemed out of line by behavioral finance econophasters such as the creepy interventionist Richard Thaler, who, very ignorant of probability, calls this “mental accounting”*2 a mistake (and, of course, invites government to “nudge” us away from it, and prevent strategies from being ergodic).

"And we can see these rules evolved over time to become more universal, expanding to a broader set, to progressively include slaves, other tribes, other species (animals, economists), etc. And one property of these laws: they are black-and-white, binary, discrete, and allow no shadow. You cannot steal “a little bit” or murder “moderately”—just as you cannot keep kosher and eat “just a little bit” of pork at Sunday barbecues. I don’t think that if you fondled the breast of the wife or girlfriend of some random weight lifter in front of him, you would do well in the intervening noisy episode, nor would you be able to convince him that it was “just a little bit.” Now, it would be vastly more likely that these values emerged from a minority than a majority. Why? Take the following two theses: Outcomes are paradoxically more stable under the minority rule—the variance of the results is lower and the rule is more likely to emerge independently across separate populations. What emerges from the minority rule is more likely to be black-and-white, binary rules. An example. Consider that an evil person, say an economics professor, decides to poison the collective by putting some product into soda cans. He has two options. The first is cyanide, which obeys a minority rule: a drop of poison (higher than a small threshold) makes the entire liquid poisonous. The second is a “majority-style” poison; it requires more than half the ingested liquid to be poisonous in order to kill. Now look at the inverse problem, a collection of dead people after a dinner party. The local Sherlock Holmes would assert that, conditional on the outcome that all people drinking the soda having been killed, the evil man opted for the first, not the second option. Simply, the majority rule leads to fluctuations around the average, with a high rate of survival. Not the minority rule. The minority rule produces low-variance in outcomes.",Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life,Nassim Nicholas Taleb,B075HYVP7C,,yellow,,location,1448,2018-06-19 04:56:00+00:00

"Static inequality is a snapshot view of inequality; it does not reflect what will happen to you in the course of your life. Consider that about 10 percent of Americans will spend at least a year in the top 1 percent, and more than half of all Americans will spend a year in the top 10 percent.*3 This is visibly not the same for the more static—but nominally more equal—Europe. For instance, only 10 percent of the wealthiest five hundred American people or dynasties were so thirty years ago; more than 60 percent on the French list are heirs and a third of the richest Europeans were the richest centuries ago. In Florence, it was just revealed that things are even worse: the same handful of families have kept the wealth for five centuries. Dynamic (ergodic) inequality takes into account the entire future and past life. You do not create dynamic equality just by raising the level of those at the bottom, but rather by making the rich rotate—or by forcing people to incur the possibility of creating an opening.

"Clearly, when you say that inequality changes from year one to year two, you need to show that those who are at the top are the same people—something Piketty doesn’t do (remember that he is an economist and has trouble with things that move). But the problem doesn’t stop there. Soon, I discovered that—aside from deriving conclusions from static measures of inequality—the methods he used were flawed: Piketty’s tools did not match what he purported to show about the rise in inequality. There was no mathematical rigor. I soon wrote two articles (one in collaboration with Raphael Douady, another with Andrea Fontanari and Pasquale Cirillo, published in Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Applications), about the measure of inequality that consists in taking the ownership of, say, the top 1 percent and monitoring its variations. The flaw is that if you take the inequality thus measured in Europe as a whole, you will find it is higher than the average inequality across component countries; the bias increases in severity with processes that deliver a high degree of inequality. All in all, the papers had enough theorems and proofs to make them about as ironclad a piece of work as one can have in science; although it was not necessary, I insisted on putting the results in theorem form because someone cannot contest a formally proved theorem without putting in question his own understanding of mathematics.",Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life,Nassim Nicholas Taleb,B075HYVP7C,,yellow,,location,2256,2018-06-19 04:56:00+00:00

"There is a difference between beliefs that are decorative and different sorts of beliefs, those that map to action. There is no difference between them in words, except that the true difference reveals itself in risk taking, having something at stake, something one could lose in case one is wrong.

"Ergodicity: In our context here, ergodicity holds when a collection of players have the same statistical properties (particularly expectation) as a single player over time. Ensemble probabilities are similar to time probabilities.

"I will always remember my encounter with the writer and cultural icon Susan Sontag, largely because I met the great Benoit Mandelbrot on the same day. It took place in 2001, two months after the terrorist event of September, in a radio station in New York. Sontag, who was being interviewed, was piqued by the idea of a fellow who “studies randomness” and came to engage me. When she discovered that I was a trader, she blurted out that she was “against the market system” and turned her back to me as I was in mid-sentence, just to humiliate me (note here that courtesy is an application of the Silver Rule), while her assistant gave me a look as if I had been convicted of child killing. I sort of justified her behavior in order to forget the incident, imagining that she lived in some rural commune, grew her own vegetables, wrote with pencil and paper, engaged in barter transactions, that type of stuff. ... Two years later, I accidentally found her obituary (I waited a decade and a half before writing about the incident to avoid speaking ill of the departed). People in publishing were complaining about her rapacity; ... She shared, with a girlfriend, a mansion in New York City, later sold for $28 million. Sontag probably felt that insulting people with money inducted her into some unimpeachable sainthood, exempting her from having skin in the game. It is immoral to be in opposition to the market system and not live (somewhere in Vermont or Northwestern Afghanistan) in a hut or cave isolated from it. But there is worse: It is much more immoral to claim virtue without fully living with its direct consequences.",Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life,Nassim Nicholas Taleb,B075HYVP7C,,yellow,,location,3153,2018-06-19 04:56:00+00:00

"Salesmen hawked how a given security would be perfect for the client’s portfolio, how they were certain it would rise in price and how the client would suffer great regret if he missed “such an opportunity”—that type of discourse. Salespeople are experts in the art of psychological manipulation, making the client trade, often against his own interest, all the while being happy about it and loving them and their company. One of the top salesmen at the firm, a man with huge charisma who came to work in a chauffeured Rolls Royce, was once asked whether customers didn’t get upset when they got the short end of the stick. “Rip them off, don’t tick them off” was his answer. He also added, “Remember that every day a new customer is born.” As the Romans were fully aware, one lauds merrily the merchandise to get rid of it.",Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life,Nassim Nicholas Taleb,B075HYVP7C,,yellow,,location,926,2018-06-19 04:56:00+00:00

"The “tragedy of the commons,” as exposed by economists, is as follows—the commons being a collective property, say, a forest or fishing waters or your local public park. Collectively, farmers as a community prefer to avoid overgrazing, and fishermen overfishing—the entire resource becomes thus degraded. But every single individual farmer would personally gain from his own overgrazing or overfishing under, of course, the condition that others don’t. And that is what plagues socialism: people’s individual interests do not quite work well under collectivism. But it is a critical mistake to think that people can function only under a private property system. What Ostrom found empirically is that there exists a certain community size below which people act as collectivists, protecting the commons, as if the entire unit became rational. Such a commons cannot be too large. It is like a club. Groups behave differently at a different scale. This explains why the municipal is different from the national. It also explains how tribes operate: you are part of a specific group that is larger than the narrow you, but narrower than humanity in general. Critically, people share some things but not others within a specified group. And there is a protocol for dealing with the outside. Arab pastoral tribes have firm rules of hospitality toward nonhostile strangers who don’t threaten their commons, but get violent when the stranger is a threat. The skin-in-the-game definition of a commons: a space in which you are treated by others the way you treat them, where everyone exercises the Silver Rule. The “public good” is something abstract, taken out of a textbook. We will see further in Chapter 19 that the “individual” is an ill-defined entity. “Me” is more likely to be a group than a single person.",Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life,Nassim Nicholas Taleb,B075HYVP7C,,yellow,discard,location,1057,2018-06-19 04:56:00+00:00

"one can see that these academico-bureaucrats who feel entitled to run our lives aren’t even rigorous, whether in medical statistics or policymaking. They can’t tell science from scientism—in fact in their eyes scientism looks more scientific than real science. For instance, it is trivial to show the following: much of what the Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler types—those who want to “nudge” us into some behavior—much of what they would classify as “rational” or “irrational” (or some such categories indicating deviation from a desired or prescribed protocol) comes from their misunderstanding of probability theory and cosmetic use of first-order models.

"When people get rich, they shed their skin-in-the-game-driven experiential mechanism. They lose control of their preferences, substituting constructed preferences for their own, complicating their lives unnecessarily, triggering their own misery. And these constructed preferences are of course the preferences of those who want to sell them something. This is a skin-in-the-game problem, as the choices of the rich are dictated by others who have something to gain, and no side effects, from the sale.

"This is why I say that the Left has always been, in its essential inspiration, antibureaucratic. Because it has always been founded on a different set of assumptions about what is ultimately real—that is, about the very grounds of political being. Obviously Leftists don’t deny the reality of violence. Many Leftist theorists think about it quite a lot. But they don’t tend to give it the same foundational status. Instead, I would argue that Leftist thought is founded on what I will call a “political ontology of the imagination” (though it could also, perhaps just as well, have been called an ontology of creativity or making or invention.)","The Utopia of Rules: On Technology, Stupidity, and the Secret Joys of Bureaucracy",David Graeber,B00MKZ0QZ2,,yellow,,location,1302,2018-06-18 04:56:00+00:00

"If artistic avant-gardes and social revolutionaries have felt a peculiar affinity for one another ever since, borrowing each other’s languages and ideas, it appears to have been insofar as both have remained committed to the idea that the ultimate, hidden truth of the world is that it is something that we make, and could just as easily make differently. In this sense, a phrase like “all power to the imagination” expresses the very quintessence of the Left. From a left perspective, then, the hidden reality of human life is the fact that the world doesn’t just happen. It isn’t a natural fact, even though we tend to treat it as if it is—it exists because we all collectively produce it. We imagine things we’d like and then we bring them into being. But the moment you think about it in these terms, it’s obvious that something has gone terribly wrong. Since who, if they could simply imagine any world that they liked and then bring it into being, would create a world like this one?71 Perhaps the leftist sensibility was expressed in its purest form in the words of Marxist philosopher John Holloway, who once wanted to title a book, “Stop Making Capitalism.”72 Capitalism, he noted, is not something imposed on us by some outside force. It only exists because every day we wake up and continue to produce it. If we woke up one morning and all collectively decided to produce something else, then we wouldn’t have capitalism anymore. This is the ultimate revolutionary question: what are the conditions that would have to exist to enable us to do this—to just wake up and imagine and produce something else?","The Utopia of Rules: On Technology, Stupidity, and the Secret Joys of Bureaucracy",David Graeber,B00MKZ0QZ2,,yellow,,location,1315,2018-06-18 04:56:00+00:00
Scientists investigate the nature of physical laws so as to understand the forces that govern the universe. Police are experts in the scientific application of physical force in order to enforce the laws that govern society. This is to my mind the essence of right-wing thought: a political ontology that through such subtle means allows violence to define the very parameters of social existence and common sense.70,"The Utopia of Rules: On Technology, Stupidity, and the Secret Joys of Bureaucracy",David Graeber,B00MKZ0QZ2,,yellow,,location,1297,2018-06-18 04:56:00+00:00
"It is indeed possible to do this, but it takes a lot of work. And the larger the group, the more formal mechanisms have to be put in place. The single most important essay in this whole activist tradition is called “The Tyranny of Structurelessness,”170 written in the 1970s by Jo Freeman, about organizational crises that occurred in early feminist consciousness-raising circles when those groups began to attain a certain size. Freeman observed that such groups always started out with a kind of rough-and-ready anarchism, an assumption that there was no need for any formal, parliamentary rules-of-order type mechanisms at all. People would just sit down in a sisterly manner and work things out. And this was, indeed, what happened at first. However, as soon as the groups grew to over, say, twenty people, informal cliques invariably began to emerge, and small groups of friends or allies began controlling information, setting","The Utopia of Rules: On Technology, Stupidity, and the Secret Joys of Bureaucracy",David Graeber,B00MKZ0QZ2,,yellow,,location,2934,2018-06-18 04:56:00+00:00
"The standardization of products, storage, certification, record-keeping, redistribution, and accounting all seem to have emerged in small towns along the Tigris and Euphrates and its tributaries in the fifth millennium BCE, a thousand years before the “urban revolution.”145 We don’t really know how or why; we don’t even know whether there were actual bureaucrats (in the sense of a distinct class of trained officeholders) or whether we are simply talking about the emergence of bureaucratic techniques. But by the time historical records do kick in there certainly are: we find vast temple and palace complexes with a hierarchy of trained scribes carefully registering and allocating resources of every sort.","The Utopia of Rules: On Technology, Stupidity, and the Secret Joys of Bureaucracy",David Graeber,B00MKZ0QZ2,,yellow,,location,2555,2018-06-18 04:56:00+00:00
"In the same way, when one takes a “realist” position in International Relations, one assumes that states will use whatever capacities they have at their disposal, including force of arms, to pursue their national interests. What “reality” is one recognizing? Certainly not material reality. The idea that nations are humanlike entities with purposes and interests is purely metaphysical. The King of France had purposes and interests. “France” does not. What makes it seem “realistic” to suggest it does is simply that those in control of nation-states have the power to raise armies, launch invasions, and bomb cities, and can otherwise threaten the use of organized violence in the name of what they describe as their “national interests”—and that it would be foolish to ignore that possibility. National interests are real because they can kill you. The critical term here is “force,” as in “the state’s monopoly on the use of coercive force.” Whenever we hear this word invoked, we find ourselves in the presence of a political ontology in which the power to destroy, to cause others pain or to threaten to break, damage, or mangle others’ bodies (or just lock them in a tiny room for the rest of their lives) is treated as the social equivalent of the very energy that drives the cosmos. Contemplate, if you will, the metaphors and displacements that make it possible to construct the following two sentences:","The Utopia of Rules: On Technology, Stupidity, and the Secret Joys of Bureaucracy",David Graeber,B00MKZ0QZ2,,yellow,,location,1286,2018-06-18 04:56:00+00:00

"Whenever all or part of a sensory experience suddenly disappears, note that. By note I mean clearly acknowledge when you detect the transition point between all of it being present and at least some of it no longer being present. If you wish, you can use a mental label to help you note. The label for any such sudden ending is “Gone.” If nothing vanishes for a while, that’s fine. Just hang out until something does. If you start worrying about the fact that nothing is ending, note each time that thought ends. That’s a “Gone.” If you have a lot of mental sentences, you’ll have a lot of mental periods—full stops, Gones!","Tools of Titans: The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers",Timothy Ferriss,B01HSMRWNU,,yellow,,location,2939,2018-08-21 04:56:00+00:00
"Most “superheroes” are nothing of the sort. They’re weird, neurotic creatures who do big things DESPITE lots of self-defeating habits and self-talk. Personally, I suck at efficiency (doing things quickly). To compensate and cope, here’s my 8-step process for maximizing efficacy (doing the right things): Wake up at least 1 hour before you have to be at a computer screen. Email is the mind-killer. ... Write down the 3 to 5 things—and no more—that are making you the most anxious or uncomfortable. They’re often things that have been punted from one day’s to-do list to the next, to the next, to the next, and so on. Most important usually equals most uncomfortable, with some chance of rejection or conflict. For each item, ask yourself: “If this were the only thing I accomplished today, would I be satisfied with my day?” “Will moving this forward make all the other to-dos unimportant or easier to knock off later?” Put another way: “What, if done, will make all of the rest easier or irrelevant?” Look only at the items you’ve answered “yes” to for at least one of these questions. Block out at 2 to 3 hours to focus on ONE of them for today. Let the rest of the urgent but less important stuff slide. It will still be there tomorrow. TO BE CLEAR: Block out at 2 to 3 HOURS to focus on ONE of them for today. This is ONE BLOCK OF TIME. Cobbling together 10 minutes here and there to add up to 120 minutes does not work. No phone calls or social media allowed. If you get distracted or start procrastinating, don’t freak out and downward-spiral; just gently come back to your ONE to-do. ...

"I may be the laziest mindfulness instructor in the world because I tell my students that all they need to commit to is one mindful breath a day. Just one. Breathe in and breathe out mindfully, and your commitment for the day is fulfilled. Everything else is a bonus. There are two reasons why one breath is important. The first is momentum. If you commit to one breath a day, you can easily fulfill this commitment and preserve the momentum of your practice. Later, when you feel ready for more, you can pick it back up easily. You can say you don’t have 10 minutes today to meditate, but you cannot say you have no time for one breath, so making it a daily practice is extremely doable. The second reason is having the intention to meditate is itself a meditation. This practice encourages you to arise an intention to do something kind and beneficial for yourself daily, and over time, that self-directed kindness becomes a valuable mental habit.","Tools of Titans: The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers",Timothy Ferriss,B01HSMRWNU,,yellow,favorite,location,2921,2018-08-21 04:56:00+00:00

"Whenever there are a lot of ducks present in relatively small spaces, like the high-density ecologies of non-territorial puddle ducks, there are lots of opportunities for social interactions. For males, these social opportunities are also sexual opportunities. Because of the excess males in the population, many males end up unpaired. These unpaired males now have two reproductive options: they can wait another year and hope they have better luck; or they can try to coerce and force themselves on unwilling females. Thus, __forced copulations are an alternative male reproductive strategy.__ Males whose mates have already begun to incubate may also pursue forced copulations when they leave their mates, which creates even darker implications to the Mallard drake’s casual departure in Make Way for Ducklings.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

"After mating, female manakins build nests, lay clutches of two eggs, incubate them, and care for the developing young entirely on their own without any help from the males, whose contributions to reproduction end with their sperm donations. Because females do all the work, they don’t depend on the males for anything, and their independence allows them almost total sexual autonomy. This freedom of mate choice has allowed extreme preferences to evolve; females only choose the few males whose behavioral and morphological features meet their very high standards. The rest will be losers in the mating game. Thus the aesthetic extremity of male manakins is an evolutionary consequence of extreme aesthetic failure, which results from strong sexual selection by mate choice.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

This coevolutionary definition of art implies that art necessarily emerges within an aesthetic community, or population of aesthetic producers and evaluators. In a now classic paper of aesthetic philosophy from 1964, Arthur Danto called this taste-making, aesthetic community “the artworld.” This new, coevolutionary definition of art opens up an entirely new connection between evolutionary biology and the arts. Perhaps the most revolutionary consequence of this definition of art is that it means that bird songs, sexual displays, animal-pollinated flowers, fruits, and so on are art, too. They are biotic arts that have emerged within myriad biotic artworlds, each of them a community that fostered the coevolution of animal aesthetic traits and preferences over time.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

"Of course, it has long been clear that sexual coercion and sexual violence are directly harmful to the well-being of female animals. But the aesthetic perspective allows us to understand that sexual coercion also infringes upon their individual freedom of choice. Once we recognize that coercion undermines individual sexual autonomy, we are led, inexorably, to the discovery that freedom of choice matters to animals. Sexual autonomy is not a mythical and poorly conceived legal concept invented by feminists and liberals. Rather, sexual autonomy is an evolved feature of the societies of many sexual species. As we have learned from ducks and other birds, when sexual autonomy is abridged or disrupted by coercion or violence, mate choice itself can provide the evolutionary leverage to assert and expand the freedom of choice.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

"In the previous chapter, I proposed that human evolution has been greatly influenced by female aesthetic remodeling of maleness in ways that advanced the progress of female freedom of choice. Here, I am suggesting that male same-sex behavior has evolved by an extension of this same process. Again, this hypothesis does not imply that male same-sex behavior evolved through female preferences for weaker, subservient, feminized, or emasculated males that females can socially or physically dominate, though these female mating preferences will reduce the ability of males to dominate females of future generations. Rather, this female choice mechanism will lower the total effectiveness of coercive male sexual control and thereby increase the proportion of future fertilizations that occur due to mate choice. Ever-lower rates of sexual coercion will be associated with an ever-higher likelihood of the success of female choice, which will result in a sexual autonomy snowball. The aesthetic theory of the evolution of male same-sex behavior does not imply that men with a predominantly same-sex orientation have any physical or social personality traits that differ from those of other males. Exactly the contrary, in fact. The hypothesis maintains that there is nothing distinctive about such men, because the features that evolved along with same-sex preferences have become a typical component of human maleness in general. Therefore, individuals with exclusively same-sex sexual preferences are distinctive only in the exclusivity, not in the existence, of their same-sex desires.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

"Like coevolved duck vaginal morphologies, this paternity assurance strategy proposed by Hrdy is a coevolved defensive response to sexual conflict. Primate females do not actually achieve sexual autonomy through multiple mating. Rather, they are making the best of a terrible situation. Females seek out multiple mates not because they prefer them but because females who mate multiply with socially ambitious males may prevent the future murder of their offspring. The primatology literature is filled with detailed descriptions of female strategies to deceive other males into imagining their paternity without threatening the dominant male’s sexual control. But like the defensive vaginal morphology of the ducks, this defensive mating strategy also has a big downside, because it, too, initiates a violent sexual arms race. Dominant males will respond to a female’s promiscuity with ever more aggressive efforts to control her reproductive life. These amped-up coercive strategies include mate guarding, violent physical punishment, and social intimidation. Sexually speaking, the average female old-world monkey is caught between a rock and a hard place.

"The bio-anthropologist and primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy was among the first to theorize about female evolutionary response to infanticide in her 1981 book, The Woman That Never Evolved. At that time, female primates were often described as sexually and socially inert individuals that merely responded passively to male social dominance and hierarchy. Drawing from her years of work on langurs in India, Hrdy emphasized that female old-world monkeys are active, evolved agents in pursuit of their own social and sexual interests. Hrdy observed that in evolutionary response to infanticide, many female primates attempt to mate with multiple subdominant males during their estrous periods. Why? Hrdy hypothesized that a female mates multiply to convince other males that they might be the father of her offspring. Consequently, that male may be less likely to kill offspring that could be his. Thus, female monkeys evolved to mate promiscuously as a way of obtaining “insurance policies” against future infanticide should any of these males ascend to social dominance.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

"Infanticide by males is a premier example of sexual conflict. It furthers the selfish reproductive interests of the dominant males at the expense of the reproductive interests of the females. However, this process is not just bad for the females of the species; it’s inherently maladaptive, because the overall population of the species can be diminished as a result. Infanticide is not adaptive, because it does not improve the fit of the organism to its environment. Rather, infanticide evolves by male-male competition with each dominant male trying to gain advantage over other, previous males. But unlike the typical male-male battles like elk stags fighting it out with their antlers, infanticide is sexual conflict because it harms the evolutionary interests of females.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

"Unfortunately for females, primate social hierarchies are inherently unstable. Younger, stronger males are always seeking social and physical opportunities to depose the dominant male within their social group. The results of this hierarchical instability for females are both shocking and instructive. When one male deposes the previously dominant male, he obviously gains new opportunities for advancing his own reproductive success through his newly won social and sexual control over the females. However, the new top guy cannot immediately capitalize on these reproductive opportunities, because at any given time most females in his group will be either pregnant or breast-feeding dependent young. Breast-feeding continues for months or even years, during which ovulation is suppressed and the females do not mate. Consequently, males of many primate species have evolved to create new reproductive opportunities for themselves by killing all the dependent offspring of females when they gain control of the group. When a female’s dependent child is killed, the fact that she is no longer breast-feeding will cause her to go into estrous, at which point she will resume mating. Infanticide is a selfish male solution to the problem of how to capitalize quickly on the advantages of having won the male-male competition. However, the results are devastating for female reproductive success and for the population as a whole. For example, in Chacma Baboons (Papio hamadryas ursinus) in Botswana, infanticide by males accounts for 38 percent of all infant mortality—as high as 75 percent in some years—and is more significant than any other cause of death.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

"Although there is not yet enough comparative evidence about orgasm in various female monkeys and apes to support the conclusion that female orgasm has evolved or expanded in pleasure in humans since common ancestry with chimpanzees, I hope that proposing the Pleasure Happens hypothesis will lead to further investigations to test it. Until then, we can see that the Pleasure Happens hypothesis is congruent with lots of the current data. For example, the indirect sexual selection that drives the Pleasure Happens mechanism will be less efficient at evolutionary design than direct natural selection can be. In addition, female choice is not the only source of sexual selection in humans, so this mechanism may not predominate in determining the evolution of female sexuality. Thus, the Pleasure Happens mechanism is congruent with the fundamental variability of human female orgasm.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

"According to the Pleasure Happens hypothesis, female sexual pleasure and orgasm have evolved (that is, expanded in capacity and intensity since common ancestry with chimpanzees; evolutionary context 2) through indirect selection by women’s mating preferences for those male traits and behaviors that they find sexually pleasurable. Because human mating preferences are largely remating preferences, based on repeated sexual encounters, female mate choice can encompass aesthetic evaluation of the physiological, sensory, and cognitive experiences of sex itself. As selection by female mating preferences gradually transformed male mating behavior, females’ own capacity for subjective pleasure coevolved and expanded to become more complex, intense, and satisfying. To be as explicit as possible, the aesthetic proposal is that human female sexual pleasure and orgasm have evolved because females have preferred to mate, and remate, with males who stimulated their own sexual pleasure; females have thereby also selected indirectly for those genetic variations that contributed to the expansion of their own pleasure. By selecting on male traits and behavior that elicit orgasm more frequently, female mate choice has evolutionarily transformed the nature of female pleasure.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

In the Pleasure Happens mechanism, we must focus on the coevolution of the subjective experience of pleasure with the features that elicit that pleasure. This means recognizing that the experience of mate choice is, in and of itself, pleasurable, something that is still rarely acknowledged in the scientific literature on mate choice.

This chapter proposes that the decrease in violence and weapons were the lucky result of female mate choice, where females just happened to prefer these things aesthetically, but they later turned out to increase female autonomy and reproductive success.

"Last, advocates of the upsuck hypothesis have surprisingly failed to think through the adaptive implications of their own model. If human female orgasm has evolved to mechanically increase the probability of fertilization, then human males should have evolved adaptive counterstrategies to induce these sperm-sucking orgasms during each and every copulation. What is human intelligence useful for if it cannot be applied by males to further their reproductive success? As a counterstrategy to female orgasmic sperm sorting, men should have evolved a universal, assiduous interest in women’s sexual climaxes. As many a woman can attest, this has not happened. But the evidence goes beyond the anecdotal. Anthropological data from a range of cultures document that there are plenty of men who take little interest in women’s sexual pleasure and orgasm. In many societies, men initiate sex with minimal foreplay and proceed to climax without ever concerning themselves with the woman’s pleasure. In fact, in many cultures, men aren’t even aware that it’s possible for a woman to have an orgasm (or at least such knowledge was rare prior to the Internet). A 2000 survey found that 42 percent of college-educated Pakistani men did not know that women were capable of orgasm. Furthermore, many patriarchal cultures actively suppress women’s capacity for orgasm through clitorectomy and other forms of female genital mutilation. The overwhelming indifference (not to mention frequent hostility) toward female sexual pleasure and orgasm by men in many of the world’s cultures is a glaring explanatory failure of the upsuck theory.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

Purposes that female orgasm was enhanced by female mate, and remate, choice for their own pleasure. Calls this the pleasure happens hypothesis, analogous to the beauty happens hypothesis.

"Rare among primates, male mating preferences for female sexual ornaments have clearly evolved on the uniquely human branch of the Tree of Life. The very fact that males have strong preferences would seem to be counter-indicated by one of the more tiresome evolutionary psychology truisms—the idea that because sperm are cheap and numerous, and eggs are expensive and rare, men are sexually profligate and women are sexually coy. The problem with this stereotype is how poorly it reflects human behavior. Despite the adaptive story of male profligacy and female coyness, the average lifetime numbers of sex partners for men and for women, at least in Western societies, are actually not that different. Moreover, an open-ended desire for sex with random strangers can’t have had much to do with human evolutionary history. Until only a few hundred human generations ago, when the development of agriculture resulted in greater population density, human groups were so small and dispersed that random sexual encounters would have been extremely rare outside periods of warfare. So male sexual behavior could not have evolved through specific selection to copulate with strangers. In fact, male sexual behavior has evolved in the opposite direction—toward choosiness.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

"Unlike the other apes, females of our species have evolved concealed ovulation, and therefore individual acts of sexual intercourse have a particularly low probability of leading to fertilization. Therefore, it would be better to think of humans as having remating preferences.

"Similarly, there is a large evolutionary psychology literature on facial “femininity”—that is, relatively small chin and large eyes, high cheekbones, and full lips—as an evolutionary indicator of female “reproductive value,” or the remaining, individual, lifetime reproductive potential. This set of features is assumed to peak at puberty and decline with age. The problem with this idea is that youth is not heritable! Everybody starts young and gets older with time. So, male mating preferences for youthful mates with lots of future reproductive potential may be advantageous for males, but such preferences will not, by themselves, result in any evolution in females. The only plausible evolutionary response to mating preferences for indicators of youth is the evolution of traits that lie about age. So, to the extent that male mate choice focuses on reproductive value, we should predict the evolution of attractive, arbitrary traits that are dishonest about age. Thus, preferences for facial “femininity” are excellent evidence that mate choice is not adaptive but arbitrary.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

"These data demonstrate that rich male social relationships—bromance, not dominance and aggression—are the paths to male sexual success in the manakins. The loners and the antisocial males that cannot get along with others will be the sexual losers within a manakin lek. Of course this raises the question of how female Wire-tailed Manakins know which males have the richest social lives, because they rarely if ever see the coordinated male performances and presumably don’t have access to tallies of the number of Facebook friends each male has. However, while females can only select directly on male display behaviors that they see and evaluate, they also select indirectly for males with the most complex and sustainable social relationships. If practice makes perfect, perhaps by choosing the best displayers, females are also choosing those males who have engaged in the most varied, frequent, and enduring social collaborations. So if we ask, what goes into social and sexual success among manakins, the answer is probably a combination of genetics, development, and social experience.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

"The intense, multi-tiered competition creates the strongest sexual selection measured in any vertebrate animal. For example, in his long-term study of Long-tailed Manakins (Chiroxiphia linearis) in Costa Rica, David McDonald was able to show that a very few males may obtain fifty to a hundred copulations per year for five or more years, while most males never have any opportunities to mate. The behavioral ecologist Emily DuVal found something similar when she conducted a remarkably exhaustive study of sexual selection in the Lance-tailed Manakin in Panama. By using the DNA fingerprints of chicks in the nest to establish paternity, DuVal documented that all young were sired by alpha males. Furthermore, out of a single age cohort of twenty-one males, only five of them became alphas, and four of those five were responsible for siring fifteen offspring, while the rest sired no chicks at all over a period of nine years. Clearly, Chiroxiphia females have such strong mating preferences that there will be far more losers than winners in the sexual competition. Chiroxiphia society is like a giant Ponzi scheme in which over 90 percent of males must lose. So why do they do it? Obligatory male-male cooperation is a total loss for the vast majority of males. The only reason it can happen is that females are completely in charge. Males have no options because there is no other game in town. Like the judges of a male-pairs figure skating competition—or better yet, of a male-pairs pole dancing contest—females can be as picky as they want to be, or as picky as they have evolved to be.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

"So, why do males participate in leks? The best explanation is that males must aggregate because the females prefer it. In polygynous species like manakins, as we’ve seen, females do all the work of parenting entirely by themselves. They build the nest, lay the eggs, incubate the clutch, and feed and protect the nestlings until fledging. In exchange for all their efforts, females have gained control over fertilization. Males have no choice but to submit to female preferences because any renegade male that refuses to join a lek will lose any possible prospect for reproduction. The females are in charge, and male rebellion will lead to sexual irrelevance.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

"Confusion about the nature and function of leks dates back to Darwin himself, who was divided in his assessment. He discussed avian lek behavior in several sections of The Descent of Man. In “The Law of Battle” section he interpreted it in the context of male-male competition, which is how most evolutionary biologists have discussed it ever since, down to this very day. But in the “Vocal Music” and “Love-Antics and Dances” sections he wrote about lekking birds in the context of female mate choice. For over a century, Darwin was unusual in considering even the possibility that leks could have anything to do with female choice. In the absence of a working theory of female mate choice or sexual autonomy, it’s not surprising that theorists of the evolutionary origin of leks have generally conceived of lek organization as a purely male-male competition phenomenon—a product of the struggle for male dominance or control. The traditional hypothesis is that the males within a lek fight it out ritualistically in order to establish a hierarchy, and the females acquiesce to mate with the dominant male. Females would thereby win the male who was by definition “the best,” because he had fought his way to the top of the hierarchy. This fit in well with the Wallacean notion that all sexual selection is a form of adaptive natural selection.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

"This is a dark evolutionary tale with an amazing and profoundly redemptive outcome. What we learn from our investigations into duck sex is that despite the ubiquity of sexual violence in these breeding systems, female mate choice continues to predominate. Consequently, male plumages, songs, and displays continue to evolve. Beauty continues to thrive, even in the face of pervasive, violent attempts to subvert the freedom of mate choice that creates it. However, female sexual autonomy is not a form of female power over males. It is merely a mechanism for the assurance of freedom of mate choice. Female ducks do not exert sexual control over males, and they can always be turned down by the mates they prefer. Females do not, indeed cannot, evolve to assert power over others in response to sexual violence. Rather, females can only evolve to assert their own freedom of choice. In this way, the concept of a sexually antagonistic coevolutionary arms race is really misleading because the “war of the sexes” is highly asymmetrical. Males evolve weapons of control, while females are merely coevolving defenses that create opportunity for choice. It’s not a fair fight, because only males are really at war.

"To return once again to McCracken’s question—what are the ridiculously long penises of these ducks doing inside the female’s body? The answer turns out to be, “It depends.” If the copulation is solicited, then clearly the female is in for the full ride. These penile structures can easily penetrate to the upper reaches of her reproductive tract if only momentarily. However, if the copulation is resisted by the female, then the penis’s length and surface features are designed, evolutionarily speaking, to try to overcome the barriers imposed by female vaginal complexity. In the text above, I didn’t use the metaphor of the forbidding cliff face lightly. It’s clear that the ridges and hooks on the penis have evolved precisely for the purpose of helping it to claw its way through the various structures within the duck’s vagina that are designed to keep it out. However, by being overwhelmingly successful at bottling up the penis during forced intromission, and preventing the vast majority of attempts at forced fertilizations, female ducks have managed to maintain the advantage in this sexual arms race. Even in the face of persistent sexual violence, female ducks have been able to assert and advance their sexual autonomy—their individual freedom to control paternity through their own mate choices.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

"This chapter, like the research grant that had its fifteen minutes of infamy back in 2013, has focused on a group of birds in which female mate choice is threatened by male sexual coercion. What happens when mate choice is constrained, prevented, or denied by physical force? we asked. And as we have seen, the female ducks do not simply cave under the threat of violence or even death. Rather, their shared standards of beauty—even meaningless, arbitrary beauty—provide them with the evolutionary leverage to fight back against sexual coercion and reassert their freedom of choice over fertilization. Female ducks teach us a great lesson about the unexpected power of female sexual autonomy. In the words of the Eurythmics and Aretha Franklin song, they teach us that “Sisters are doin’ it for themselves!” By doing so, females together become the agents of choice and the guarantors of their own freedom of choice. The evolutionary advantages of obtaining the mates they prefer—male offspring that will possess the traits they and other females have agreed are attractive—are so strong that they have reshaped female internal anatomy. Expanded sexual autonomy allows female waterfowl to continue to select for beauty in the form of male sexual display and everything that that involves—sounds, colors, behaviors, plumage, and so on.

"But what was the cause of all this anatomical variation? The key insight was that there was a correlation between the more highly elaborated genital structures and the social and sexual lives of the species who possessed them. In monogamous, territorial waterfowl like swans, Canada Goose, and Harlequin Duck, males have a very small penis (about one centimeter) without any surface features, and females have simple vaginas without cul-de-sacs or spirals. But in non-territorial species, which frequently engage in forced copulations, like the Muscovy Duck, Pintail, Ruddy Duck, and, yes, even the Mallards in Make Way for Ducklings, males have evolved longer, intricately armed penises, and females have evolved increasingly complex vaginal structures.

"The revelation of an aesthetic mechanism for the evolution of female sexual autonomy in waterfowl is a profoundly feminist scientific discovery. It is not feminist by accommodating the science to any contemporary political theory or ideology. Rather, it is a feminist discovery in that it demonstrates that sexual autonomy matters in nature. Sexual autonomy is not merely a political idea, a legal concept, or a philosophical theory; rather, it is a natural consequence of the evolutionary interactions of sexual reproduction, mating preferences, and sexual coercion and violence in social species. And the evolutionary engine of sexual autonomy is aesthetic mate choice. Only by acknowledging that these are real forces in nature can we make progress toward a complete understanding of the natural world. Of course, this should not be too surprising.

In cases like waterfowl, sexual conflict can create an ever-escalating war between the sexes, which is called sexually antagonistic coevolution. This process results in a kind of arms race between males and females, in which each sex evolves successive behavioral, morphological, or even biochemical mechanisms to overcome the evolved efforts by the other sex to assert control or freedom of choice over reproduction.

This allows the females to observe the males aesthetic sensibilities from code distance to make their judgements.

"Duck sex provides a premier example of sexual conflict over fertilization and allows us to investigate how Darwin’s proposed “taste for the beautiful” creates the opportunity for the further evolution of sexual autonomy. A key insight is that both fundamental mechanisms of sexual selection in waterfowl—mate choice based on female aesthetic preferences for male displays, and male-male competition for control over fertilization—are occurring and in evolutionary opposition to each other. ... Rather, sexual violence is a selfish male evolutionary strategy that is at odds with the evolutionary interests of its female victims and possibly with the evolutionary interests of the entire species. By maiming and killing females, such violence lowers the population size of the species. And by further skewing the sex ratios, these violent deaths make sexual conflict even worse, because there will be more males losing out in the mate choice competition who will therefore be motivated to pursue this counterproductive strategy. Thus, sexual conflict in ducks demonstrates yet again Darwin’s insight that sexual selection is not equivalent to natural selection.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

"The cost to females of forced copulations is very high. Females are often injured, and not infrequently killed, in the process. So, why do female ducks fight back so vigorously? Female ducks absorb greater direct harm to their physical well-being by resisting forced copulations than if they acquiesced, so the intensity of their resistance seems difficult to explain from an evolutionary perspective. Nothing is more threatening to the ability to pass on one’s genes than death, so why risk death by struggling? This question delivers us to the crux of the complex interaction between the female acting on her sexual desire for beauty and the male using sexual violence to subvert her ability to choose her own mate. What is at stake in these attempts at forced fertilization is more than just the direct cost to a female’s health and well-being; forced fertilizations will also create indirect, genetic costs to the female that may be even more important to the female. Why? Because females that succeed in mating with the males they prefer will likely have offspring that inherit the display traits that they, and other females also, prefer. These females will have the benefit of greater numbers of descendants through their sexually attractive offspring. This is the indirect, genetic benefit of mate choice that drives so much of aesthetic coevolution. Females that are forcibly fertilized, however, will have offspring that are sired by males that have random display traits, or traits that have been specifically rejected because they have failed to meet female aesthetic standards. Either way, the resulting male offspring will be less likely to inherit genes for the preferred male ornamental traits, and they will therefore be less sexually attractive to other females and less likely to obtain mates, which will result in fewer grandchildren for that female. This is the indirect, genetic cost of male sexual violence.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

"“Forced copulations” is the term that ornithologists and evolutionary biologists now use to refer to rape among birds and other animals. The use of the word “rape” was routine in animal biology for over a century, but it was largely abandoned in the 1970s in response to multiple avenues of feminist critique. In particular, in Against Our Will, Susan Brownmiller built a powerful and effective argument that rape, and the threat of rape, in human societies functions as a mechanism for social and political oppression of women. Human rape is an act with such great symbolic and social impact that the term didn’t seem appropriate in the context of nonhuman animals. As the ornithologist Patty Gowaty has written, “Because of the important differences between rape and forced copulations, those of us who study animal behavior agreed years ago to refer to ‘forced copulation’ in non-human animals, and to reserve the term ‘rape’ for humans.”",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

Given such a wealth of options, female ducks have evolved lots of elaborate mating preferences for colorful male plumage, extravagant displays, and complex, funky acoustic stimuli.

"The aerodynamic theory of the origin of feathers was an example of an adaptationist approach to the origin of novelty. However, this big twentieth-century intellectual project failed. During the hundred years in which everyone was certain that feathers had evolved through natural selection on scales for flight, we learned nothing about how feathers actually evolved. We only made progress on the evolution of feather innovations by shelving the questions of the selective function of each innovation and searching for evidence and predictions concerning feather evolution within the details of feather development. The advantage of this evo-devo approach is that we can figure out what happened in feather evolution before we try to investigate why it happened. Once we understand the progress of feather evolution, we can return to questions about the selective advantages of different stages in feather evolution. Early tubular and tufty stages have been convincingly hypothesized to have evolved for thermoregulation and water repellency. However, there is still no accepted hypothesis for why tufty down feathers (stage II) evolved into vaned feathers (Stage IIIa to Stage IV). What evolutionary advantage could the planar feather vane have provided prior to the evolution of flight? It is clear that a plumage made up of downy feathers, like a modern chick, would be warm enough or water repellent enough to provide any thermoregulatory requirements. After all, baby ducklings manage to stay very warm and very dry with downy plumages. Is it possible that the original selective advantage of the planar vane was actually aesthetic? Obviously, down is fuzzy. Although downy chicks are cute, the plumage coloration pattern complexity that can be produced with fuzzy down feathers is aesthetically quite limited. Just like hair, you can make different down feathers different colors, and you have a limited ability to make the tips and bases of down feathers different colors. But that’s it. The innovative planar feather vane, however, creates a well-defined, two-dimensional surface on which it is possible to create a whole new world of complex color patterns within every feather. In aggregate, many planar feathers can create complex plumage patches and a crisp, smooth, new outline to the entire body plumage.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

Males have two strategies for passing along their genes, be attractive to females or force mating. In non territorial species there are many opportunities for social interactions, and this more opportunities for forced copulation.

"Interestingly, females will not be harming their own survival and fecundity by preferring males that make attractive songs with extreme wing bones. Rather, females with preferences for males with maladaptive wing bones will only pay an indirect, genetic cost for their preferences, because their daughters may inherit more awkward wing bones, which will interfere with their daughters’ survival and fecundity. However, this indirect genetic cost to mate choice can be outweighed by a simultaneous indirect, genetic benefit of having sexually attractive male offspring. Because the maladaptive costs of aesthetically extreme mate choices are deferred by each generation of choosers, the whole population can ease further and further into decadence and dysfunction generation by generation. The population will not be saved from decadence by natural selection, because the maladaptive functional costs are indirect and will be more than balanced by the advantages of having beautiful, sexually attractive offspring. Nevertheless, the entire population becomes increasingly maladapted because the fit between the organisms and the environment gets worse and worse over time.

"By comparison to other birds, the major changes in wing anatomy that Bostwick discovered in Club-winged Manakins are truly startling. The ulnas of other manakins are simple hollow, columnar tubes. But the ulnas of male Club-winged Manakins are so wildly different they are nearly unidentifiable as the same bone. They are four times wider and three times larger in volume than those of other manakins, despite actually being shorter in length. The upper surface of the ulna of male Club-wings also features a prominent, wide shelf with deep sculpted grooves and peaks for ligamentous attachments to the oscillating secondary feathers. There is nothing else like it in any other bird in the world. Even more surprisingly, however, the ulnas of male Club-winged Manakins are solid bone, and the calcium in these bones is two or three times denser than in the wing bones of other manakins. In contrast, more than half the volume of other manakin ulnas is occupied by a hollow internal space. In fact, every other species of bird on the planet has hollow ulnas. Even theropod dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex and Velociraptor have hollow ulnas! Thus, in order to sing their wing feather songs, male Club-winged Manakins have dramatically transformed anatomical features of their wings that have been consistently present for over 150 million years.

"The Club-winged Manakin’s wing song provides a likely stark example of evolutionary decadence—an evolved decrease in the overall survival capacity and fecundity of a population through mate choice. It is this discomfiting prospect of evolutionary decadence that was so threatening to adaptationism that entertaining arbitrary sexual selection without abundant proof was branded as “methodologically wicked.” According to the adaptive mate choice theory, these costly wing bones are evidence that attractive males are good enough to survive these extra physiological and functional challenges. However, recall from chapter 1 that Zahavi’s original handicap (that is, Smucker’s) principle does not actually work; if the costs of the ornament are directly related to the benefits, there can be no payoff. The only way to fix the handicap principle is to break it, by assuming that better males get to cheat by paying relatively lower costs for each incremental advantage in quality. There is no evidence of such costs in any organism, and certainly not Club-winged Manakins. I think the aesthetically transformed wing anatomy of male Club-winged Manakins is compelling and excellent evidence that sexual decadence evolves in nature, but without physiological evidence about the costs the case could still be considered inconclusive.

"Despite its enduring strangeness to many, the Lande-Kirkpatrick sexual selection mechanism is not merely an alternative hypothesis to adaptive mate choice; it is the appropriate null model for the evolution of sexual display traits and mating preferences. It describes how evolution by mate choice works when nothing special is happening—that is, when mates are choosing what they prefer, period. Because evolution requires genetic variation to occur, the Lande-Kirkpatrick model assumes genetic variation in trait and preference. But it does not assume that mates vary in quality, that any display traits are correlated with that quality, or that mating preferences are under natural selection to prefer those traits. That is why it is the null model. If the Lande-Kirkpatrick mechanism is the appropriate null model for evolution of traits and preferences, then it cannot be proven.

"Today, however, all biologists embrace the fundamental concept of mate choice. Thus there is complete consensus that the ornamental plumage and behavior of the Great Argus have evolved through the agency of female sexual preferences and desire—that is, sexual choice. We now agree that ornament evolves because individuals have the capacity, and the freedom, to choose their mates, and they choose the mates whose ornaments they prefer. In the process of choosing what they like, choosers evolutionarily transform both the objects of their desires and the form of their own desires. It is a true coevolutionary dance between beauty and desire. What biologists don’t agree on is whether mating preferences evolve for those ornaments that provide consistently honest, practical information—about good genes or direct benefits like health, vigor, cognitive ability, or other attributes that would help the chooser—or whether they are merely meaningless, arbitrary (albeit fabulous) results of coevolutionary fashion. Actually, most biologists are in agreement with the former hypothesis. I am not. More precisely, I think that adaptive mate choice can occur but it is probably rather rare, whereas the mechanisms of mate choice envisioned by Darwin and Fisher, and modeled by Lande and Kirkpatrick, are likely to be nearly ubiquitous.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

The truth is that it is very difficult to accurately assess the genetic quality of an animal and predict its future health even with advanced knowledge and scientific tools. Can we expect the female Great Argus to be able to make better assessments of the health of their potential mates than human physicians?,The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

"The adaptive mate choice paradigm asserts that each and every one of these features has specifically evolved as an honest indicator of good genes or direct benefits. In other words, each detail evolved as it did because it was better at providing quality information than all other available variations. Most mate choice researchers see their job as demonstrating how this is true, not testing whether it is true. Without a null model that allows one to reject the adaptationist account, they cannot do otherwise. In any given study, researchers will measure multiple aspects of male ornament and try to correlate them to the health and genetic information they are presumably providing, but at best only one or a few of the many aesthetic features of the full display repertoire will show any sign of a correlation with mate quality. Biologists then use this very limited subsample of their data to draw general conclusions about the role of honest signaling in the process of sexual selection as a whole. The vast majority of the data inevitably fail to confirm the adaptive theory of mate choice. As a result, the vast majority of the ornamental details remain unexplained even as the adaptive explanation of mate choice triumphs.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

"By claiming that evolution by mate choice was a special process with its own, distinctive internal logic, Darwin fought against the powerful scientific and intellectual bias toward simplicity and unification. Of course, many of Darwin’s Victorian antagonists were recent converts from religious monotheism to materialist evolutionism. Their historic monotheism might have predisposed them to adopt a powerful new monoideism; they replaced a single omnipotent God with a single omnipotent idea—natural selection. Indeed, contemporary adaptationists should question why they feel it is necessary to explain all of nature with a single powerful theory or process. Is the desire for scientific unification simply the ghost of monotheism lurking within contemporary scientific explanation? This is another implication of Darwin’s really dangerous idea. If evolutionary biology is to adopt an authentically Darwinian view, it must recognize, as he did, that natural selection and sexual selection are independent evolutionary mechanisms. In this framework, adaptive mate choice is a process that occurs through the interaction of sexual selection and natural selection. I will use this language throughout this book.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

"In the Wallacean tradition, Grafen strongly endorsed the comforting “rhyme and reason” of adaptation over the unnerving arbitrariness of aesthetic Darwinism. Then Grafen went in for the kill: “To believe in the Fisher-Lande process as an explanation of sexual selection without abundant proof is methodologically wicked.” I do not know of any other contemporary scientific debate in which one side has actually been branded as wicked! Not even cold fusion! Clearly, this is not an everyday scientific debate. In a striking reprise of St. George Mivart’s moralizing tone, Grafen’s outsized response indicates the intellectual magnitude of what is at stake. Darwin’s really dangerous idea—aesthetic evolution—is so threatening to adaptationism that it must be branded as wicked. Nearly one hundred years after Wallace advocated his pure form of Darwinism, Grafen deploys the same Wallacean insistence to try to win the debate again.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

"Zahavi promoted the handicap principle with a single-minded fervor. But his idea had one big flaw. If the sexual advantage of an ornament is directly proportional to its survival costs, then the two forces will cancel each other out, and neither the costly ornament nor a mating preference for it can evolve. In a 1986 paper boldly titled “The Handicap Mechanism of Sexual Selection Does Not Work,” Mark Kirkpatrick provided a mathematical proof of this evolutionary trap. ... The Smucker’s principle further demonstrates that Zahavi’s handicap principle is fundamentally incompatible with the aesthetic nature of sexual display. Sexual displays actually evolve because they are attractive, not disgustingly informative or repulsively honest. If the sole purpose of sexual display is to communicate the capacity to survive a great burden, then why are sexual traits ornamental? Why isn’t acne sexually attractive? After all, acne is frequently an honest indicator of a surge of adolescent hormones and would therefore provide reliable information about youth and fertility. Why don’t organisms evolve genuine handicaps like partially formed body parts? Why don’t individual organisms gnaw off a limb to show how good they are at surviving without the missing appendage? Why not two limbs? That would really say something about how hardy they are! Or, why not poke out an eye? The reason, or course, is that the handicap principle is disconnected from the fundamentally aesthetic nature of mate choice and therefore nearly irrelevant to nature. ... In 1990, Alan Grafen at Oxford came to the rescue of the failing handicap principle. The stakes were high. The entire neo-Wallacean mate choice paradigm was on the line. Of course, Grafen was forced to acknowledge Kirkpatrick’s proof of the failure of the handicap principle as originally articulated by Zahavi. However, Grafen showed mathematically that a nonlinear relationship between display cost and mate quality could salvage the theory. In other words, if lower-quality males pay a proportionally higher cost to grow or display an attractive trait than do higher-quality males, then the handicap could evolve. If a handicap is like a test, then Grafen proposed that higher-quality individuals basically get an easier test. The only way to fix the handicap principle was to actually break it.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

Much more convincing than the first chapter. Argues that Fischer's mate choice model, elaborated on by Lande and Kirkpatrick, is an appropriate null hypothesis for sexual ornamentation because it presumes only the existence and variability of preferences, but nothing about correlation between traits and any measures of fitness.

Argues against the signaling theory on the basis that getting honest signals about good genes and health is really difficult, even modern medical science has a hard time doing so.

Notes that the hypothesis that symmetry as an indicator fit health has failed replication.

"Although I am rather hesitant to admit it, I think that the process of adaptation by natural selection is sort of boring. Of course, as an evolutionary biologist I am well aware that it is a fundamental and ubiquitous force in nature. I do not deny its immense importance. But the process of adaptation by natural selection is not synonymous with evolution itself. A lot of evolutionary process and evolutionary history cannot be explained by natural selection alone. Throughout this book, I will argue that evolution is frequently far quirkier, stranger, more historically contingent, individualized, and less predictable and generalizable than adaptation can explain. Evolution can even be “decadent,” in the sense of its resulting in sexual ornaments that not only fail to signal anything about objective mate quality but actually lower the survival and fecundity of the signaler and the chooser. In short, in pursuit of their subjective preferences, individuals can make mating choices that are maladaptive—resulting in a worse fit between the organism and its environment. This is something that quite a few evolutionary biologists would argue is impossible, but I beg to differ, and this book is my explanation of why. In the larger sense, I hope to communicate to my readers that natural selection alone cannot possibly explain the diversity, complexity, and extremity of the sexual ornaments we see in nature. Natural selection is not the only source of design in nature.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

"By contrast, let’s imagine the evolution of an avian ornament, such as the song of the thrush or the iridescent plumage of the hummingbird. These features evolve in response to criteria very different from those involved in natural selection on beak shape. Sexual ornaments are aesthetic traits that have evolved as a result of mate choices based on subjective evaluations. They function through the perception and evaluations of other individuals through mate choice. The cumulative effect of many individual mating decisions shapes the evolution of ornament. In other words, members of these species act as agents in their own evolution. As Darwin himself realized, evolution by natural selection and aesthetic evolution by mate choice produce profoundly different patterns of variation in nature. For example, there are a limited number of ways to crack open a seed with a bird beak and therefore a limited number of variations in beak size and shape to do it. Consequently, seed-eating birds from more than a dozen different bird families have independently and convergently evolved very similar, robust, finchy beak shapes in order to perform this particular physical task. But the task of attracting a mate is an infinitely more open-ended, unconstrained, and dynamic challenge than opening a seed. Each species evolves its own solution to the challenge of intersexual communication and attraction—what Darwin called independent “standards of beauty.” Thus, it is no surprise that each of the world’s ten thousand plus bird species has evolved its own, unique aesthetic repertoire of ornaments and preferences to accomplish this task. The result is the earth’s nearly unfathomable variety of biological beauty.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O. Prum,B01KE61LPW,,yellow,,location,197,2019-05-06 04:56:00+00:00
"Fisher actually proposed a two-stage evolutionary model: one phase for the initial origin of mating preferences, and a second, subsequent phase for the coevolutionary elaboration of trait and preference. The first phase, which is solidly Wallacean, holds that preferences initially evolve for traits that are honest and accurate indices of health, vigor, and survival ability. Natural selection would ensure that mate choice based on these traits would lead to objectively better mates and to genetically based mating preferences for these better mates. But then, after the origin of mating preference, Fisher hypothesized in his second-phase model, the very existence of mate choice would unhinge the display trait from its original honest, quality information by creating a new, unpredictable, aesthetically driven evolutionary force: sexual attraction to the trait itself. When the honest indicator trait becomes disconnected from its correlation with quality, that doesn’t make the trait any less attractive to a potential mate; it will continue to evolve and to be elaborated merely because it is preferred. In the end, according to the Fisher phase-two model, the force that drives the subsequent evolution of mate choice is mate choice itself. In an exact reversal of the Wallacean view of natural selection as neutralizing sexual selection, arbitrary aesthetic choices (per Darwin) trump choices made for adaptive advantage (per Wallace), because the trait that was originally preferred for some adaptive reason has become a source of attraction in its own right. Once the trait is attractive, its attractiveness and popularity become ends in themselves. According to Fisher, mating preference is like a Trojan horse. Even if mate choice originally acts to enhance traits that carry adaptive information, desire for the preferred trait will eventually undermine the ability of natural selection to dictate the evolutionary outcome. Desire for beauty will endure and undermine the desire for truth.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

"Although Darwin’s proposal of animal cognitive choice is now the accepted wisdom, the second implication of his aesthetic theory of sexual selection remains as revolutionary today, and as controversial, as when he first proposed it. By using the words “beauty,” “taste,” “charm,” “appreciate,” “admire,” and “love,” Darwin was suggesting that mating preferences could evolve for displays that had no utilitarian value at all to the chooser, only aesthetic value. In short, Darwin hypothesized that beauty evolves primarily because it is pleasurable to the observer.",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

"The most notable and revolutionary feature of Darwin’s theory of mate choice is that it was explicitly aesthetic. He described the evolutionary origin of beauty in nature as a consequence of the fact that animals had evolved to be beautiful to themselves. What was so radical about this idea was that it positioned organisms—especially female organisms—as active agents in the evolution of their own species. Unlike natural selection, which emerges from external forces in nature, such as competition, predation, climate, and geography, acting on the organism, sexual selection is a potentially independent, self-directed process in which the organisms themselves (mostly female) were in charge. Darwin described females as having a “taste for the beautiful” and an “aesthetic faculty.”",The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World - and Us,Richard O.

Presents Darwin's really dangerous idea as the idea that subjective judgements about aesthetics could drive evolution.

Rejects the idea that sexual ornamentation have value in showing the health of individuals. Also rejects handicap theory. Has a bad argument based on the advertising slogan that Smucker's is an unattractive name, increasing the likelihood that the ham is good. If so, he argued, shouldn't there be competition to form increasingly unattractive names? No, this does not account for conditioning on w collider. The name only indicates good jam if the item is already successful.

R. A. Fischer's account of evolution for beauty that starts as utilitarian but becomes aesthetic because mates are chosen based on the mediating variable. Eventually, the correlation between ornament and fitness lessens, but the genes for being attracted to the ornament are already in the population, so it continues on.",yellow,h1,location,291,2019-05-06 04:56:00+00:00
"When we ask precisely how a society will go about preserving its citizens’ property, we can expect the reply that it will do so by the use of force. This reply introduces a dilemma. While it is true that there are ways of forcibly restraining a thief, it is also true that no amount of force can lead the Artful Dodger truly to acknowledge a gentleman’s title to the handkerchief in his pocket. Until the young ruffian is persuaded freely to respect that title, he will remain a thief. By extension, this observation applies to the society as a whole. __There is no effective pattern of entitlement in a society short of the free agreement of all opponents that the titles to property are in the hands of the actual winners. No force will establish this agreement.

As finite players we will not enter the game with sufficient desire to win unless we are ourselves convinced by the very audience we intend to convince. That is, unless we believe we actually are the losers the audience sees us to be, we will not have the necessary desire to win. The more negatively we assess ourselves, the more we strive to reverse the negative judgment of others.

The more we are recognized as winners, the more we know ourselves to be losers. That is why it is rare for the winners of highly coveted and publicized prizes to settle for their titles and retire. Winners, especially celebrated winners, must prove repeatedly they are winners. The script must be played over and over again. Titles must be defended by new contests.

* You are who people expect you to be, in light of their past experience with you.
* __The first impression you give is the “right” one, and it shapes how everything else about you is perceived.__
* You are like the other members of groups to which you appear to belong.
* If you have a very positive trait—if you are smart, beautiful, funny, kind, and so forth—you are likely to have other positive traits.

Being humble about your accomplishments and being willing to own up to your past or current difficulties—to be vulnerable and human—can actually be a remarkably effective communication strategy.

Weeping, for instance, implies that someone is particularly emotionally sensitive. You aren’t actually aware that you are asking (and answering) this question. It happens automatically, below your awareness, and in fractions of a second. It is also relatively effortless and riddled with biases that shape the conclusion you ultimately draw. In Phase 2 of perception, you engage in correction or discounting, by taking into account other factors, like the situation the behavior is occurring in.

"But as my good friend, Lehigh University psychologist Gordon Moskowitz, discovered, there are ways to make people aware of their egalitarian ideals—to activate the goal for them in a given interaction, in case they don’t do it for themselves.2 First, you can use the power of labeling. In general, people will try to conform to the labels they are given, provided that the labels are positive and not totally inconsistent with their existing views. For example, when individuals who contributed to a charity were told that they were “a generous donor,” they gave significantly more money two weeks later when asked for another donation. It’s as if they thought to themselves, Well, after all, I am a generous donor, and giving more is what generous donors do.3 You can harness this power by complimenting your perceiver on his or her “fairness,” “unbiased assessment,” “keen perception,” or “uncanny accuracy” when it comes to perceiving others. If you don’t know the perceiver well and would have no basis to make such a judgment, you can try a different approach—suggest that in the perceiver’s line of work or in his or her position in the company, the ability to accurately and fairly assess others “must be a key skill to possess.” You wouldn’t be lying, since this is always a key skill to possess, no matter what someone does for a living.

When relevance or closeness is low, the threat is diminished and you will be seen more accurately.

"As I mentioned, the essence of self-esteem is comparison. How does the perceiver see himself or herself, in terms of abilities and accomplishments, compared with other people? Psychologist Abraham Tesser argues that a person’s self-esteem can be enhanced or threatened by the achievements and shortcomings of another as a function of two factors.5 The first is relevance. Does the domain of achievement (or failure) really matter to the perceiver? Does it factor into the perceiver’s own sense of who he or she is? A professional tennis player is likely to be affected when a rival wins a major tournament, but not when a famous chef opens another successful restaurant. It’s not success per se that threatens the player—it’s the particular successes that he or she covets. The second is closeness. Is this other successful person a major player in the perceiver’s life or an unknown or distant person who can easily be ignored? Perceivers are really only affected—for better or worse—by those whom they see regularly or feel strongly about. This is why sibling rivalry is a thing, and second-cousin-once-removed rivalry isn’t.

"You see, the ego lens, like the trust and power lenses, has a single mission. In this case, it’s to see things in such a way that the perceiver comes out on top. The ego lens has several strategies that it can deploy to accomplish this mission, each of which I’ll describe in detail in this chapter. Put simply, they are as follows: Focus on how the perceiver is better than you or on how the perceiver’s group (us) is better than your group (them). Focus on how you and the perceiver are in the same group (i.e., both of you are us) and therefore the perceiver can enjoy your successes and bask in the reflected glory of your awesomeness. Decide that your good qualities are not a threat, because you are not competing with the perceiver for the same resources or because the perceiver doesn’t actually value those particular qualities. If strategies 1, 2, and 3 don’t work or aren’t applicable, your good qualities and accomplishments are a threat to the perceiver’s self-esteem.

"Just about every research finding I’ve described so far in the chapter is obtained not only when participants have a generally higher sense of power, but also when they were momentarily made to feel powerful in the experiment. And that part is really important, because when we witness instances of bad behavior among the rich and powerful, it’s easy to assume that the kind of people who seek power are also the kind of people who take crazy risks and behave irresponsibly and unethically.

"Fortunately, there is a way to resolve this paradox: focus on projecting those qualities of warmth that do not appear to evoke low competence—the moral aspects of warmth. Research by Paul Rozin (the psychologist who convinced me to abandon my chemistry major for a career in psychology, God bless him) and his colleagues has argued that moral character, rather than overall warmth, is really the best predictor of whether someone will act on his or her good intentions toward you, and therefore is the better indicator of whom to trust. They found that traits like courageous, fair, principled, responsible, honest, and loyal—traits that lack the touchy-feeliness we generally associate with warmth—convey good intentions and trustworthiness even better than traits like sociable, funny, and agreeable, and without the connotations of low competence. (Of course, sociable, funny, and agreeable have the advantage of being much easier to convey, particularly in a short time.

"Also, it goes without saying that to be instrumental, you need to do everything that is directly asked of you—but where you can really stand out is by anticipating your boss’s needs, before he or she asks.

I wrote her the most glowing recommendation I’ve ever written for a student. And when she left my lab and moved on to graduate school, I was depressed for a week. That’s instrumentality. Instrumentality isn’t about being nice—it’s about being useful.

And of course, being warm signals that you are a friend and not a foe, which is good. But believe me when I tell you that powerful people by and large don’t give a damn that you think they are awesome.

"When powerful people experience feelings of threat—when, say, the source of their power is illegitimate or unstable—they often negatively stereotype subordinates even more. For instance, a set of studies found that people assigned to be group leader paid particular attention to negative stereotypic information about their other group members, but only when these leaders were randomly chosen to be group leaders. When, instead, they felt they had earned the role through an evaluation of their social skills and suitability for the job, the bias disappeared.8 Research like this suggests that powerful leaders can and do use negative stereotyping strategically, to bolster their sense of entitlement to power.",No One Understands You and What to Do About It,Heidi Halvorson,B00O92Q6D0,,yellow,,location,1157,2019-04-15 04:56:00+00:00
"And remember how power is generally associated with superior performance? I should probably explain why—or more specifically, when—it’s not. You see, powerful people often have a lot on their plates, and it stands to reason that they can’t possibly bring their best to everything. They need to decide where to put their effort and where to hold back. So, how do they decide? The short and unsurprising answer is that people with power generally withhold effort when they feel that the task in question is unworthy of a powerful person—in other words, when it seems like the kind of thing an underling would do. This attitude can and does affect performance. For example, in the research by Galinsky I referred to earlier, when participants were given boring, repetitive tasks like filling out multiplication tables, those assigned to a leadership role (i.e., those given power) performed worse than nonleaders and complained that they didn’t think it was the sort of task a leader should have to do.",No One Understands You and What to Do About It,Heidi Halvorson,B00O92Q6D0,,yellow,,location,1131,2019-04-15 04:56:00+00:00

These biases were nicely illustrated in a study of forty-four married couples, roughly half of whom were currently in marriage counseling. Those in counseling (or, as the researchers referred to them, the “distressed” group) were more likely to have a negative bias—they saw their partner in a far less flattering light than the partner did and tended to hold the partner more personally responsible for any bad behaviors they had engaged in.8 So while Larry may see himself as a fairly conscientious guy who occasionally forgets to take the garbage out (who doesn’t?), his wife, Susan, sees him as irresponsible and inconsiderate, leaving her (once again) to pick up the slack.

"That networks of cities, and the transnational organizations based on those cities, can operate over, and give coherence to, large geographical areas cutting across state boundaries, has been recognized since the pioneering work of Fernand Braudel, who refers to these areas as ‘world-economies’.55 It is too early, however, to tell whether these world-economies are as real as the other regionalized locales that have been analysed in this chapter. Some of the processes that are supposed to endow these economic locales with coherence, such as the synchronized movement of prices across large geographical areas following long temporal rhythms (the so-called ‘Kondratieff waves’), remain controversial. But what is clear even at this stage of our understanding is that approaches based on reductionist social ontologies do not do justice to the historical data. This is particularly true of macro-reductionist approaches, such as the so-called ‘world-systems analysis’ pioneered by Immanuel Wallerstein, in which Braudel’s original idea is combined with theories of uneven exchange developed by Latin American theorists.56 In Wallerstein’s view, for example, only one valid unit of social analysis has existed since the end of the Thirty Years War, the entire ‘world-system’. Explanations at the level of nation-states are viewed as illegitimate since the position of countries in the world-system determines their very nature.57 An assemblage approach, on the other hand, is more compatible with Braudel’s original idea. Although he does not use the concept of ‘assemblage’, he views social wholes as ‘sets of sets’, giving each differently scaled entity its own relative autonomy without fusing it with the others into a seamless whole.58 It has been the purpose of this book to argue the merits of such a nonreductionist approach, an approach in which every social entity is shown to emerge from the interactions among entities operating at a smaller scale. The fact that the emergent wholes react back on their components to constrain them and enable them does not result in a seamless totality. Each level of scale retains a relative autonomy and can therefore be a legitimate unit of analysis. Preserving the ontological independence of each scale not only blocks attempts at micro-reductionism (as in neoclassical economics) and macro-reductionism (as in world-systems analysis) but also allows the integration of the valuable insights that different social scientists have developed while working at a specific spatiotemporal scale, from the extremely short duration of the small entities studied by Erving Goffman to the extremely long duration of the large entities studied by Fernand Braudel. Assemblage theory supplies the framework where the voices of these two authors, and of the many others whose work has influenced this book, can come together to form a chorus that does not harmonize its different components but interlocks them while respecting their heterogeneity.",A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity,Manuel DeLanda,B00OOV4GHY,,yellow,,location,2239,2019-04-25 04:56:00+00:00
"In formal models of urban dynamics, assemblages of cities of different sizes emerge from a sequence of symmetry-breaking events, as each town confronts centripetal processes, like the capture of population, investment and other resources, as well as centrifugal ones, like congestion, pollution, traffic. At the tipping-point, when one set of forces begins to dominate the other, a town may grow explosively or shrink to a small size in the shadow of a larger one.34 In computer simulations the actual pattern that emerges is not unique - as if there existed a single optimal pattern to which the urban dynamics always tended - but is, on the contrary, highly sensitive to the actual historical sequence of events. For this reason, the emergent pattern of urban centres is like a memory of this symmetry-breaking sequence ‘fossilized in the spatial structure of the system’.35",A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity,Manuel DeLanda,B00OOV4GHY,,yellow,,location,2043,2019-04-25 04:56:00+00:00
"Changes in connectivity, in turn, impinge in a variety of ways on the social activities performed in a given locale. Fernand Braudel, for example, argues that the connectivity of some residential buildings in the eighteenth century changed dramatically at the same time that the function of the rooms became more specialized, with the bedroom in particular becoming a fully detached region. As he writes, the new connectivity contrasted sharply with that which characterized previous buildings: In a Parisian town house of the seventeenth century, on the first floor, which was the noble storey, reserved for the owners of the house, all the rooms - antechambers, salons, galleries and bedrooms - opened off each other and were sometimes hard to tell apart. Everyone, including servants on domestic errands, had to go through all of them to reach the stairs.5 A hundred years later, some rooms had become public while others were strictly private, partly as a result of the fact that the routine circulation through a house was now constrained by a different distribution of doors and hallways. Privacy, in a sense, was created by the new regionalization of these locales.",A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity,Manuel DeLanda,B00OOV4GHY,,yellow,,location,1820,2019-04-24 04:56:00+00:00
"The introduction of internal transportation also had expressive effects. Thus, the apartment buildings that were constructed prior to the elevator, in Paris for example, displayed a clear vertical stratification in which the social status of the inhabitants decreased with height. After the elevator was introduced, this stratification of regions was reversed, with apartments higher up expressing increased status.7 Other expressive components vary with the activities housed by the building. In the case of residential buildings, the distinctive furniture of their internal regions and the decorative treatment of walls, floors and ceilings, have often played a role in the marking of social-class territories. Ostentatious displays in the aristocratic homes of Renaissance Italy, as Braudel reminds us, were in fact a way of using luxury as a means of domination. But as he goes on to argue, this luxury was purely expressive, since until many centuries later it was not associated with any kind of material comfort.8",A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity,Manuel DeLanda,B00OOV4GHY,,yellow,,location,1839,2019-04-24 04:56:00+00:00
"This brings me to the question of the more or less episodic interactions between hierarchical assemblages of organizations and other social entities. Of all the different interactions I will pick a single one, interactions with a population of persons, and of all the different political situations in which these interactions may take place I will select the situation created by the existence of armed conflict, whether external or internal. On the material side, this situation calls for both recruitment of people - sometimes voluntary, sometimes coerced - as well as the necessary taxation to pay for war. The central policies in which these goals are stated (a draft resolution, a change in fiscal policy) must take into consideration resistance from the target groups, so they involve concessions and political dialogue. The situation may be framed in resource-dependence terms: taxes and military recruits are such an important resource for a government that it comes to depend on its population to obtain them, thereby becoming subject to its demands. In fact, according to Charles Tilly, this is exactly how modern rights of citizenship came into being in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, as governments engaged in the expansion of their armies (and of the taxes needed to pay for them) had to bargain with the target-groups and yield to their demands for political participation.52 On the expressive side, these situations call for a variety of means -some symbolic, some directly expressive - to strengthen the unity of a government and the population. The classical example is the effect that the French Revolution had on the composition of armies, that is, the change from mercenary to loyal citizen armies. The means used to effect this change in different countries, however, varied with the existing sources of legitimacy. Two of the forms of legitimacy discussed by Weber, traditional and rational-legal, have counterparts at larger scales. In some countries the bonds uniting a population are inherited or come from a long tradition, so that the ‘nation’ precedes the ‘state’. In others, these bonds emerge from the sharing of the same laws, that is, the ‘state’ precedes the ‘nation’.53 Countries that followed the state-to-nation path (such as France or England) tended to favour newly invented expressions of patriotism: flags, oaths, anthems, national holidays, military parades, official celebrations. Those that followed the nation-to-state path (Germany) tended towards more populist expressions, using more or less coherent syntheses of popular elements created by intellectual elites. However, just as Weber’s ideal types rarely exist in pure form, blood and law as sources of national unity were never mutually exclusive. Most countries used a mix of these two sources of legitimacy when rallying their populations for war. And ultimately, regardless of what combination of expressive means a given government used, the ultimate display of patriotism…",A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity,Manuel DeLanda,B00OOV4GHY,,yellow,,location,1734,2019-04-18 04:56:00+00:00

"In the rational-legal type it is the very fact that procedures work in a technical sense: that is, that they regularly produce the desired outcome that expresses their legitimacy. On the other hand, given that sometimes it is not easy to evaluate whether a procedure really works, even in the most technical organizations the concept of ‘rationality’ may be used in a purely ceremonial way. It will all depend on the extent to which the quality of the outcomes (goods or services) of a technical process can be easily evaluated. The more complex the outputs and production processes, the more uncertain the evaluation, and the less clear the technical expression of legitimacy. In these circumstances it makes sense for organizations, when documenting and justifying their efficiency to other organizations, to stick to ceremonial ‘rituals of rationality’ to buffer themselves from criticism.7 In the manufacture of mass-produced goods, for example, the technical aspect is strong and the ceremonial relatively weak, but in mental health clinics, legal agencies and schools, the evaluation of outputs may become largely ceremonial, particularly when these organizations express their legitimacy to government agencies issuing licences or permits.8",A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity,Manuel DeLanda,B00OOV4GHY,Ok how bureaucracies justify themselves.,yellow,,location,1330,2019-04-17 04:56:00+00:00
"This makes this assemblage - in which the relations of exteriority between components are exemplified by a contractual relation through which some persons transfer rights of control over a subset of their actions to other persons - particularly important. Moreover, it is only in this type of authority structure that organizational resources are associated with a position not with the person occupying it. This strict separation results in an assemblage with clear-cut emergent properties in which an explanation of the behaviour of the organization does not need to include a description of the personal characteristics of the leaders, or in which such a description would be causally redundant. With a full separation of office from incumbent the organization itself may be considered a goal-oriented corporate actor.

We can then separate those elements that play an expressive role, that is, those components that express the legitimacy of the authority, from those playing a material role, those involved in the enforcement of obedience, without worrying about the components that vary from one hierarchical organization to another, from factory equipment and weapons to corporate logos and military uniforms.

"In conclusion, we may conceptualize social classes as assemblages of interpersonal networks and institutional organizations. Both the networked communities and the organizations in which their common interests crystallize must be thought as having differential access to resources, some playing a material some an expressive role, as well as possessing a distinctive life-style composed of both material and expressive elements. A variety of practices of exclusion and inclusion perform the main territorializing work, while linguistic categories code the result of such a territorialization, consolidating the identity of a class. These identifying boundaries, however, must be seen as contingent and precarious. Social mobility, for example, can act as a deterritorializing process blurring the borders between classes, and technological innovation, by introducing novel resources, may further differentiate each class into several conflicting groups. Thus, we may accept that a population of networked communities is sorted out into social classes without having to agree that these classes form a simple hierarchy except in territorial states in which classes are relatively small and undifferentiated.",A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity,Manuel DeLanda,B00OOV4GHY,,yellow,,location,1260,2019-04-12 04:56:00+00:00

The expression of these identity claims must be done carefully, that is, performed in such a way that the image projected cannot be easily discredited by others. Any given conversation will present its participants with opportunities to express favourable information about themselves, as well as with risks to express unfavourable facts.

"In the explanation of a concrete social process it may not be immediately clear whether the causal actors are the micro-components or the macro-whole. The ambiguity can be eliminated if there are many equivalent explanations of the process in question at the micro-level, for example, if a coalition between communities which was in fact created by the negotiations between a specific group of activists could have been created by negotiations among other alternative activists. In other words, we may be justified in explaining the emerging coalition as the result of the interaction between entire communities if an explanation of the micro-details is unnecessary because several such micro-causes would have led to a similar outcome.18 In the same way, a large organization may be said to be the relevant actor in the explanation of an interorganizational process if a substitution of the people occupying specific roles in its authority structure leaves the organizational policies and its daily routines intact. Such a substitution would, of course, have to respect specialties (managers replaced by other managers, accountants by accountants, engineers by engineers), but if the emergent properties and capacities of the organization remain roughly the same after such a change, then it would be redundant to explain the interorganizational outcome by reference to specific managers, accountants and engineers, when reference to many other such specialists would have left the outcome approximately invariant.",A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity,Manuel DeLanda,B00OOV4GHY,,yellow,,location,702,2019-04-08 04:56:00+00:00
"The lesson from these two examples is that taxonomic essentialism relies on a very specific approach to yield its reified generalities: it starts with finished products (different chemical or biological species), discovers through logical analysis the enduring properties that characterize those products, and then makes these sets of properties into a defining essence (or a set of necessary and sufficient conditions to belong to a natural kind). To avoid reification we must instead focus on the historical processes that produce those products, with the term ‘historical’ referring to cosmological and evolutionary history in addition to human history. Assemblage theory, as outlined in the previous chapter, avoids taxonomic essentialism through this manœuvre. The identity of any assemblage at any level of scale is always the product of a process (territorialization and, in some cases, coding) and it is always precarious, since other processes (deterritorialization and decoding) can destabilize it. For this reason, the ontological status of assemblages, large or small, is always that of unique, singular individuals. In other words, unlike taxonomic essentialism in which genus, species and individual are separate ontological categories, the ontology of assemblages is flat since it contains nothing but differently scaled individual singularities (or hacceities). As far as social ontology is concerned, this implies that persons are not the only individual entities involved in social processes, but also individual communities, individual organizations, individual cities and individual nation-states.",A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity,Manuel DeLanda,B00OOV4GHY,,yellow,,location,529,2019-04-08 04:56:00+00:00
"Let me summarize this chapter’s argument so far. The ontological status of any assemblage, inorganic, organic or social, is that of a unique, singular, historically contingent, individual. Although the term individual’ has come to refer to individual persons, in its ontological sense it cannot be limited to that scale of reality. Much as biological species are not general categories of which animal and plant organisms are members, but larger-scale individual entities of which organisms are component parts, so larger social assemblages should be given the ontological status of individual entities: individual networks and coalitions; individual organizations and governments; individual cities and nation-states. This ontological manœuvre allows us to assert that all these individual entities have an objective existence independently of our minds (or of our conceptions of them) without any commitment to essences or reified generalities. On the other hand, for the manœuvre to work, the part-to-whole relation that replaces essences must be carefully elucidated. The autonomy of wholes relative to their parts is guaranteed by the fact that they can causally affect those parts in both a limiting and an enabling way, and by the fact that they can interact with each other in a way not reducible to their parts, that is, in such a way that an explanation of the interaction that includes the details of the component parts would be redundant. Finally, the ontological status of assemblages is two-sided: as actual entities all the differently scaled social assemblages are individual singularities, but the possibilities open to them at any given time are constrained by a distribution of universal singularities, the diagram of the assemblage, which is not actual but virtual.",A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity,Manuel DeLanda,B00OOV4GHY,,yellow,,location,760,2019-04-08 04:56:00+00:00
"Natural kinds, on the other hand, are not the only source of essentialist myths. Aristotle begins his analysis at a level above that of natural kinds, with the genus ‘animal’, and via logical differentiation reaches the level of species (‘horse’, ‘human’). The question is, if his species can be replaced by individual singularities, can the same be done to his genera? The answer is that the highest levels of biological classifications, that of kingdom (the level that includes plants and animals) or even phyla - including the phylum ‘chordata’ to which humans as vertebrate animals belong - need a different treatment. A phylum may be considered an abstract body-plan common to all vertebrates and, as such, it cannot be specified using metric notions such as lengths, area or volumes, since each realization of the body-plan will exhibit a completely different set of metric relations. Therefore only non-metric or topological notions, such as the overall connectivity of the different parts of the body, can be used to specify it. To put this differently, a body-plan defines a space of possibilities (the space of all possible vertebrate designs, for example) and this space has a topological structure. The notion of the structure of a space of possibilities is crucial in assemblage theory given that, unlike properties, the capacities of an assemblage are not given, that is, they are merely possible when not exercised. But the set of possible capacities of an assemblage is not amorphous, however open-ended it may be, since different assemblages exhibit different sets of capacities.",A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity,Manuel DeLanda,B00OOV4GHY,,yellow,,location,540,2019-04-08 04:56:00+00:00
"And the same point applies to larger assemblages. Cities interact causally with one another by competing for immigrants from rural regions, for natural resources such as water or agricultural land and for economic investment. Large cities, for example, can cast a ‘causal shadow’ over their surroundings, inhibiting the formation of new towns within their sphere of influence by depriving them of people, resources or trade opportunities. But, of course, it is not the cities as physical entities that can interact this way, but cities as locales for the activities of their inhabitants, including merchants, investors and migrants, as well as market-places and government organizations. So why not say that it is the interactions between the performers of these activities that cause one urban centre to inhibit the growth of another? Because if we replaced the merchants by other merchants, the market-places, by other market places and so on, a very similar inhibiting effect would be achieved. On the other hand, if such a replacement led to a very different outcome that would be evidence that the phenomenon in question must be explained by mechanisms operating at a smaller scale, and that it would involve not only causes but also reasons, and even motives.",A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity,Manuel DeLanda,B00OOV4GHY,,yellow,,location,713,2019-04-08 04:56:00+00:00
"It is possible, however, to preserve the insight that a reified generality like ‘society as a whole’ can be replaced by a multiscaled social reality, as long as the part-to-whole relation is correctly conceptualized to accommodate all this complexity. First of all, although a whole emerges from the interactions among its parts, once it comes into existence it can affect those parts. As the philosopher Roy Bhaskar has argued, emergent wholes ‘are real because they are causal agents capable of acting back on the materials out of which they are formed’.12 In other words, to give a complete explanation of a social process taking place at a given scale, we need to elucidate not only micro-macro mechanisms, those behind the emergence of the whole, but also the macro-micro mechanisms through which a whole provides its component parts with constraints and resources, placing limitations on what they can do while enabling novel performances.13",A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity,Manuel DeLanda,B00OOV4GHY,,yellow,,location,655,2019-04-08 04:56:00+00:00

"Let me summarize the main features of assemblage theory. First of all, unlike wholes in which parts are linked by relations of interiority (that is, relations which constitute the very identity of the parts) assemblages are made up of parts which are self-subsistent and articulated by relations of exteriority, so that a part may be detached and made a component of another assemblage. Assemblages are characterized along two dimensions: along the first dimension are specified the variable roles which component parts may play, from a purely material role to a purely expressive one, as well as mixtures of the two. A second dimension characterizes processes in which these components are involved: processes which stabilize or destabilize the identity of the assemblage (territorialization and deterritorialization). In the version of assemblage theory to be used in this book, a third dimension will be added: an extra axis defining processes in which specialized expressive media intervene, processes which consolidate and rigidify the identity of the assemblage or, on the contrary, allow the assemblage a certain latitude for more flexible operation while benefiting from genetic or linguistic resources (processes of coding and decoding).21",A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity,Manuel DeLanda,B00OOV4GHY,,yellow,,location,357,2019-04-05 04:56:00+00:00
"So, in the first place, processes of territorialization are processes that define or sharpen the spatial boundaries of actual territories. Territorialization, on the other hand, also refers to non-spatial processes which increase the internal homogeneity of an assemblage, such as the sorting processes which exclude a certain category of people from membership of an organization, or the segregation processes which increase the ethnic or racial homogeneity of a neighbourhood. Any process which either destabilizes spatial boundaries or increases internal heterogeneity is considered deterritorializing.",A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity,Manuel DeLanda,B00OOV4GHY,,yellow,discard,location,257,2019-04-05 04:56:00+00:00

Assemblages remove the need for essences by recognizing that society is structured at a variety of different levels, where assemblages at one level will interact with each other and create the higher level assemblages emergently. Importantly, one lower level assemblage can be part of many higher level assemblages.

Assemblages can be said to have a causal impact on the world if their effects are only weakly dependent on the actual composition of the assemblage. I.e., replacing individuals with other similar individuals leads to approximately the same results.",yellow,h1,location,490,2019-04-05 04:56:00+00:00
"In addition to the exteriority of relations, the concept of assemblage is defined along two dimensions. One dimension or axis defines the variable roles which an assemblage’s components may play, from a purely material role at one extreme of the axis, to a purely expressive role at the other extreme. These roles are variable and may occur in mixtures, that is, a given component may play a mixture of material and expressive roles by exercising different sets of capacities. The other dimension defines variable processes in which these components become involved and that either stabilize the identity of an assemblage, by increasing its degree of internal homogeneity or the degree of sharpness of its boundaries, or destabilize it. The former are referred to as processes of territorialization and the latter as processes of deterritorialization.10 One and the same assemblage can have components working to stabilize its identity as well as components forcing it to change or even transforming it into a different assemblage. In fact, one and the same component may participate in both processes by exercising different sets of capacities.",A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity,Manuel DeLanda,B00OOV4GHY,,yellow,,location,228,2019-04-04 04:56:00+00:00
"While those favouring the interiority of relations tend to use organisms as their prime example, Deleuze gravitates towards other kinds of biological illustrations, such as the symbiosis of plants and pollinating insects. In this case we have relations of exteriority between self-subsistent components - such as the wasp and the orchid - relations which may become obligatory in the course of coevolution. This illustrates another difference between assemblages and totalities. A seamless whole is inconceivable except as a synthesis of these very parts, that is, the linkages between its components form logically necessary relations which make the whole what it is. But in an assemblage these relations may be only contingently obligatory. While logically necessary relations may be investigated by thought alone, contingently obligatory ones involve a consideration of empirical questions, such as the coevolutionary history of two species. In addition to this Deleuze considers heterogeneity of components an important characteristic of assemblages. Thus, he would consider ecosystems as assemblages of thousands of different plant and animal species, but not the species themselves, since natural selection tends to homogenize their gene pools. In what follows I will not take heterogeneity as a constant property of assemblages but as a variable that may take different values. This will allow me to consider not only species but also biological organisms as assemblages, instead of having to introduce another category for them as does Deleuze.9",A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity,Manuel DeLanda,B00OOV4GHY,,yellow,,location,215,2019-04-04 04:56:00+00:00

1 Assemblages against Totalities,A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity,Manuel DeLanda,B00OOV4GHY,".h1

Defines assemblages in contrast to totalities. Totalities have components that are seamlessly connected, that have no meaning outside of the totality (relations of internality). Assemblages have components that could be removed and fit into another assemblage, at least in principle (relations of exteriority).

The first feature of assemblage components is their relations of materiality our expressivity. Expressive relations are catalytic, they tend to reproduce themselves. All other relations are material. I'm not completely sure if this distinction.

The second feature describes changes that tend to make the assemblage more internally homogeneous, or make its boundaries more distinct. These are territorializing changes. Changes in the opposite direction are deterritorializing.

Finally, he brings up coding, which describes languages or genetic codes. This is specific to expressive components. It allows the assemblage to increase our decrease the rigidity of it's identity.",yellow,h1,location,153,2019-04-04 04:56:00+00:00
"The Pirahãs have built their culture around what is useful to their survival. They don’t worry about what they don’t know, nor do they think they can or do know it all. Likewise, they do not crave the products of others’ knowledge or solutions. Their views, not so much as I summarize them dryly here, but as they are lived out in the Pirahãs’ daily lives, have been extremely helpful to me and persuasive as I have looked at my own life and the beliefs that I held, many of them without warrant.

"One of the first was the apparent lack of counting and numbers. At first I thought that the Pirahãs had the numbers one, two, and “many,” a common enough system around the world. But I realized that what I and previous workers thought were numbers were only relative quantities. I began to notice this when the Pirahãs asked me when the plane was coming again, a question they enjoy asking, I eventually realized, because they find it nearly magical that I seem to know the day that the plane is arriving. ... I would hold up two fingers and say, “Hoi days,” using what I thought was their term for two. They would look puzzled. As I observed more carefully, I saw that they never used their fingers or any other body parts or external objects to count or tally with. And I also noticed that they could use what I thought meant “two” for two small fish or one relatively larger fish, contradicting my understanding that it meant “two” and supporting my new idea of the “numbers” as references to relative volume—two small fish and one medium-size fish are roughly equal in volume, but both would be less than, and thus trigger a different “number,” than a large fish. Eventually numerous published experiments were conducted by me and a series of psychologists that demonstrated conclusively that the Pirahãs have no numbers at all and no counting in any form.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"Mothers wean their children when a new child is born—usually when the previous offspring is three or four years old. Weaning is traumatic for the child for at least three reasons: loss of adult attention, hunger, and work. Everyone must work; everyone must contribute to the life of the village. The child recently stopped from nursing will have to enter this adult world of work. In addition to talking and laughter, one frequently hears the sound of children screaming and crying at night. This is almost always caused by weaning. ... The weaned child is no longer the baby, no longer treated as special compared to other children. Instead of sleeping next to Mom, the child stays with its siblings a few significant feet away from the parents on the sleeping platform. Newly weaned toddlers experience hunger, like all Pirahãs except nursing babies. But, again, minor hunger is not considered a hardship for the Pirahãs. When children first enter this adult world they are shocked.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"It is interesting to me that in spite of a strong sense of community, there is almost no community-approved coercion of village members. It is unusual for a Pirahã to order another Pirahã about, even for a parent to order about a child. This happens occasionally, but it is generally frowned upon or discouraged, as indicated by the remarks, expressions, and gestures of others watching. I cannot recall having seen an adult intervene to stop another adult from violating community norms. ... Even when provoked, as Kaaboogí was now, the Pirahãs were able to respond with patience, love, and understanding, in ways rarely matched in any other culture I have encountered. The Pirahãs are not pacifists. They are by no means perfect. But peace is valued among them, at least peace with other Pirahãs. They see themselves as a family—a family in which every member feels obliged to protect and care for every other member. This is not to say that they never violate their own norms. All groups do. But this simply highlights the norm of helping one another and its relative rarity cross-culturally.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"It appeared that they didn’t make dugout canoes because they didn’t know how, so I decided to help them learn. Since the best canoe masters in the area lived at the village of Pau Queimado, several hours away by motorboat on the Marmelos River, I decided to try to contract one of these men to spend about a week with the Pirahãs to teach them how to make canoes the Brazilian way. ... Then a few days after Simprício left, the Pirahãs asked me for another canoe. I told them that they could make their own now. They said, “Pirahãs don’t make canoes” and walked away. No Pirahã has ever made another xagaoa to my knowledge.

"I knew already that their material culture is among the simplest known. They produce very few tools, almost no art, and very few artifacts. ... Of the few artifacts they make, none are permanent. For example, if they need to carry something in a basket, they will weave a basket on the spot from wet palm leaves. After one or two uses these baskets become dried out and fragile, and they are abandoned. ... Other material artifacts include necklaces. The Pirahãs make them to ward off spirits and to look more attractive. Women, girls, and babies of both genders wear necklaces. ... The necklaces rarely show symmetry and are very crude and unattractive compared to the artifacts of other groups in the region, such as the Tenharim and Parintintin, known for beautiful feather headdresses, jaguar-tooth necklaces, fine woven baskets and strainers, and tools for manioc processing. And for the Pirahãs, necklaces are decorative only secondarily, their primary purpose being to ward off the evil spirits the Pirahãs see almost daily. They also like feathers and bright colors on the necklaces to make them visible to spirits so that the spirits are not startled—like wild animals, spirits are more likely to attack when startled. Pirahã adornment has an immediate function and involves little planning or concern for classical aesthetic values such as symmetry.

I am not angry now.” “Why were you angry?” “You told Brazilians not to sell us whiskey.” “Yes,” I admitted. “The FUNAI said no one should sell whiskey here. Your women told me not to let anyone sell whiskey to you.” (The Pirahãs knew the FUNAI somewhat, from different representatives who came by occasionally. They had observed that the FUNAI exerted some sort of vague authority over Brazilians in the region.) “You are not a Pirahã,” he declared. “You do not tell me that I cannot drink. I am a Pirahã.

"One of the things about Pirahã that immediately fascinated me was the lack of what linguists call “phatic” communication—communication that primarily functions to maintain social and interpersonal channels, to recognize or stroke, as some refer to it, one’s interlocutor. Expressions like hello, goodbye, how are you?, I’m sorry, you’re welcome, and thank you don’t express or elicit new information about the world so much as they maintain goodwill and mutual respect. The Pirahã culture does not require this kind of communication. Pirahã sentences are either requests for information (questions), assertions of new information (declarations), or commands, by and large. There are no words for thanks, I’m sorry, and so on. ... When a Pirahã arrives in the village, he or she might say, “I have arrived.” But by and large, no one says anything. If you give someone something, they might occasionally say, “That’s right,” or “It is OK,” but they use these to mean something more like “Transaction acknowledged,” rather than “Thank you.” The expression of gratitude can come later, with a reciprocal gift, or some unexpected act of kindness, such as helping you carry something. The same goes when someone has done something offensive or hurtful. They have no words for I’m sorry. They can say, “I was bad,” or some such, but do so rarely. The way to express penitence is not by words but by actions. Even in Western societies, there is considerable variation in how much we use phatic communication. Brazilians used to tell me when I was learning Portuguese, “Americans say ‘thank you’ way too much.”","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"Although Pirahã nouns are simple, Pirahã verbs are much more complicated. Each verb can have as many as sixteen suffixes—that is, up to sixteen suffixes in a row. Not all suffixes are always required, however. Since a suffix can be present or absent, this gives us two possibilities for each of the sixteen suffixes—216, or 65,536, possible forms for any Pirahã verb. The number is not this large in reality because some of the meanings of different suffixes are incompatible and could not both appear simultaneously. But the number is still many times larger than in any European language. English only has in the neighborhood of five forms for any verb—sing, sang, sung, sings, singing.

"In the rainy season (piioábaíso, “deep water”), villagers distribute themselves by nuclear families, each family occupying its own house. As I noticed during my first day in the village, the houses in the rainy season are built in a line along the river, well hidden in jungle growth, with houses usually ten to fifty paces apart. These rainy season villages are smaller than summer villages, usually consisting of one elderly couple and their adult sons or daughters, along with their spouses and children.

"Like most unusual things I observed or heard among the Pirahãs, I realized ultimately that Xahóápati was telling me more than I had realized: that to speak their language is to live their culture. A few linguists today, in the tradition of early-twentieth-century pioneers Edward Sapir and Franz Boas, also believe that culture impinges on grammar and language in nontrivial ways. But my reasons are different from most of even this minority. My difficulty in successfully translating the Bible owed largely to the fact that Pirahã society and language are interconnected in ways that make even the understanding of grammar, a subcomponent of language, impossible without studying the language and culture simultaneously. And I believe that this is true for all languages and societies. Language is the product of synergism between values of a society, communication theory, biology, physiology, physics (of the inherent limitations of our brains as well as our phonetics), and human thought. I believe this is also true of the engine of language, grammar.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"the Pirahã language is notoriously difficult because it lacks things that many other languages have, especially in the way that it puts sentences together. For example, the language has no comparatives, so I couldn’t find expressions like this is big/that is bigger. I couldn’t find color words—no simple words for red, green, blue, and so on, only descriptive phrases, like that is like blood for red or that is not ripe yet for green. And I couldn’t find stories about the past. When you can’t find something, but you expect it to be there, you can waste months looking for something that doesn’t exist.

"Instead of this quasi-religious and somewhat mystical dualism that underlies much of the work of Descartes and, on some readings, Chomsky’s work, I would propose a more concrete understanding of language. Language is a by-product of general properties of human cognition, rather than a special universal grammar, in conjunction with the constraints on communication that are common to evolved primates (such as the need for words to appear out of the mouth in a certain order, the need for units like words for things and events, and so on), and the overarching constraints of specific human cultures on the languages that evolve from them. It is clear that the original cultural circumstances can be lost. For example, a Pirahã moving to and adapting to life in Los Angeles would lose many of the cultural constraints of Pirahãs living along the Maici. His or her language might change. But if it didn’t, at least initially, this would show us that languages can indeed be separated from cultures. What I am suggesting here is trying to understand language in a situation as close to the original cultural context as possible. If this is on the right track, one cannot do linguistic field research apart from these cultural contexts—so I could not really hope to understand Pirahã by studying a Pirahã speaker in Los Angeles, or Navajo by studying a Navajo speaker in Tucson. I would need to study a language in its cultural context. I could study a language outside of its cultural context of course, and still discover many interesting things.

"We often think that what we know is “portable”—as though what we learn about perceiving and knowing the world in San Diego will enable us to perceive and understand the world competently in Delhi. But so much of what we think we know is local information, based on local perspectives, that is no easier to use in a new environment than a 110-volt appliance in a 220-volt power source. A linguist, for example, who studies linguistic theory in a modern university and then travels to the field for research, if she is sensitive to her new environment, will soon learn that her theories are not a precise fit with the languages that she encounters. Theories can be useful if they are locally adjusted. If they’re not, they can be like a Procrustean bed, in which facts are stretched and chopped to fit.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

The notion that the essence of what it means to be human is most clearly revealed in those features of human culture that are universal rather than in those that are distinctive to this people or that is a prejudice that we are not obliged to share. . . . It may be in the cultural particularities of people—in their oddities—that some of the most instructive revelations of what it is to be generically human are to be found. —CLIFFORD GEERTZ (1926–2006),"Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"Sex is not limited to spouses, though that is the norm for married men and women. Unmarried Pirahãs have sex as they wish. To have sex with someone else’s spouse is frowned upon and can be risky, but it happens. If the couple is married to each other, they will just walk off in the forest a ways to have sex. The same is true if neither member of the couple is married. If one or both members of the couple are married to someone else, however, they will usually leave the village for a few days. If they return and remain together, the old partners are thereby divorced and the new couple is married. First marriages are recognized simply by cohabitation. If they do not choose to remain together, then the cuckolded spouses may or may not choose to allow them back. Whatever happens, there is no further mention of it or complaint about it, at least not openly, once the couple has returned. However, while the lovers are absent from the village, their spouses search for them, wail, and complain loudly to everyone. Sometimes the spouses left behind asked me to take them in my motorboat to search for the missing partners, but I never did.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"Pirahãs laugh about everything. They laugh at their own misfortune: when someone’s hut blows over in a rainstorm, the occupants laugh more loudly than anyone. They laugh when they catch a lot of fish. They laugh when they catch no fish. They laugh when they’re full and they laugh when they’re hungry. When they’re sober, they are never demanding or rude. Since my first night among them I have been impressed with their patience, their happiness, and their kindness. This pervasive happiness is hard to explain, though I believe that the Pirahãs are so confident and secure in their ability to handle anything that their environment throws at them that they can enjoy whatever comes their way. This is not at all because their lives are easy, but because they are good at what they do.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"Pirahãs consider hunger a useful way to toughen themselves. Missing a meal or two, or even going without eating for a day, is taken in stride. I have seen people dance for three days with only brief breaks, not hunting, fishing, or gathering—and without any stockpiled food. How much non-Pirahãs eat relative to Pirahãs is made obvious by Pirahã reactions to food consumption when they visit the city. Pirahãs in the city for the first time are always surprised by Western eating habits, especially the custom of eating three meals a day. For their first meal outside of the village, most Pirahãs eat greedily—large quantities of proteins and starch. For the second meal they eat the same. By the third meal they begin to show frustration. They look puzzled. Often they ask, “Are we eating again?” Their own practice of eating food when it is available until it is gone now conflicts with the circumstances in which food is always available and never gone.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"Steve Sheldon told me about a woman giving birth alone on a beach. Something went wrong. A breech birth. The woman was in agony. “Help me, please! The baby will not come,” she cried out. The Pirahãs sat passively, some looking tense, some talking normally. “I’m dying! This hurts. The baby will not come!” she screamed. No one answered. It was late afternoon. Steve started toward her. “No! She doesn’t want you. She wants her parents,” he was told, the implication clearly being that he was not to go to her. But her parents were not around and no one else was going to her aid. The evening came and her cries came regularly, but ever more weakly. Finally, they stopped. In the morning Steve learned that she and the baby had died on the beach, unassisted. Steve recorded a story about this incident, repeated here. This text is valuable for two reasons. First, it recounts a tragic incident that provides insight into Pirahã culture. In particular it tells us that the Pirahãs let a young woman die, alone and without help, because of their belief that people must be strong and get through difficulties on their own. Second, it is important for our understanding of Pirahã grammar. Note the relative simplicity of the structure (not the content) of the sentences, which lack any sign of one sentence or phrase appearing inside another.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"Like all true communication channels, hum speech can “say” anything that can be said with consonants and vowels. But also like the other channels, it has a specific set of functions. Hum speech is used to disguise either what one is saying or one’s identity. It does this because even for a native Pirahã who is not paying close attention, it is hard to follow. And hum speech is conducted at very low volume. So it is also used for privacy, like our whispering. (The Pirahãs don’t whisper, they hum instead. I wondered about this for a while until German linguist Manfred Krifka reminded me of the obvious reason for it. In whispering, the vocal cords are unable to produce different tones, so Pirahã speech would be rendered unintelligible.) Hum speech is also used to talk when one’s mouth is full. Finally, it is frequently used by mothers when talking to their children. Yell speech is the use of the vowel a or, occasionally, the original vowels of the words being spoken and one of the two consonants k or x (glottal stop), to yell the musical form of the speech, that is, its tone, syllables, and stress. Yell speech is commonly used on rainy days when the rain and thunder are loud. It is used to communicate with Pirahã at long distances. It is as loud as a yell, but without consonants. It can occasionally be in falsetto.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"As I tried to absorb the implications of all of this, I wondered if there might be other applications of xibipíío in the culture or the language. Specifically, I began to rethink some of the unusual aspects of Pirahã culture and asked myself if these could be explained by the concept of immediate experience represented by xibipíío. I thought first about the expression of quantities in Pirahã. I believed that immediacy of experience might explain the disparate gaps and unusual facts about Pirahã that had been accumulating in my thoughts and notebooks over the months. It would explain the lack of numerals and counting in Pirahã, because these are skills that are mainly applied in generalizations beyond immediate experience. Numbers and counting are by definition abstractions, because they entail classifying objects in general terms. Since abstractions that extend beyond experience could violate the cultural immediacy of experience principle, however, these would be prohibited in the language. But although this hypothesis seemed promising, it still needed to be refined.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"These channels show how culture can influence language. If I didn’t know about the channels of discourse, I would not know the culturally appropriate way to communicate the different types of information that each of these channels is used for. A complete description of Pirahã culture has to include a discussion of how one communicates spiritual information, intimate information, and so on. The function of the channels is cultural. That is, the linguistic facts, the small number of phonemes and the amount of free variation between consonants that almost drove me crazy at the beginning of my work can’t be explained without the cultural information. Simply put, Pirahã may have so few sounds because it doesn’t need any more. The importance it places on these different channels makes consonants and vowels less important for the Pirahãs than they are for English, French, Navajo, Hausa, Vietnamese, and other languages. This challenges modern theories of language because these don’t expect culture to enter into the sound structure.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"Pirahã houses reveal important distinctions between their culture and ours. When I think of Pirahã houses, I am often reminded of Henry David Thoreau’s suggestion in Walden that all a person really needs is a large box that he can carry around to protect himself from the elements. The Pirahãs don’t need walls for defense, because the village is the defense—every member of the village will come to the aid of every other member. They don’t need houses to display wealth, because all Pirahãs are equal in wealth. They don’t need houses for privacy, because privacy is not a strong value—though if privacy is needed for sex, relieving oneself, or anything else, the entire jungle is around, or one can leave the village in a canoe. Houses don’t need heating or cooling, because the jungle provides a nearly perfect climate for lightly clothed human bodies. Houses are just a place to sleep with moderate protection from the rain and sun. They are places to keep one’s dogs and the few belongings that a family has. Each house is a rectangle formed by three rows of three poles each, with the center row higher to allow for the roof to be raised in the middle.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"Children are just human beings in Pirahã society, as worthy of respect as any fully grown human adult. They are not seen as in need of coddling or special protections. They are treated fairly and allowance is made for their size and relative physical weakness, but by and large they are not considered qualitatively different from adults. This can lead to scenes that to Western eyes can seem strange or even harsh. Since I find myself predisposed to agree with much of the Pirahãs’ view of parenting, I often don’t even notice child-rearing behavior that other outsiders find shocking.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"Because Pirahã uses pitch so widely, it has communication channel options that most European languages lack. I call these channels of discourse, following the pioneering work of sociolinguist Dell Hymes.There are five such channels in Pirahã, each having a unique cultural function.

"There is no “official” coercion in Pirahã society—no police, courts, or chiefs. But it exists nonetheless. The principal forms I have observed are ostracism and spirits. If someone’s behavior is abnormal in a way that bothers the majority, he or she will be ostracized by degrees. An older man, Hoaaípi, whom I met at the beginning of my career among the Pirahãs, was unusual in that he and his wife lived alone, separated from the other Pirahãs by a considerable distance. When he paddled down to see me the first of the two times I ever saw him, he came without Western goods, in a kagahóí rather than a Brazilian canoe, wearing only a loincloth. This meant that he was outside the normal relationships of trade and social intercourse that almost all Pirahãs participate in with one another. When he arrived, he was stared at more than I was. And he had a fresh arrow wound from another Pirahã, Tíigíi. He didn’t want medicine for the arrow wound, but he did want some coffee and sugar, which I happily gave him, as a fair exchange for being able to meet him. Although he seemed like a sweet old man to me, the Pirahãs did not want him around. They said that he was mean. I have no idea to this day what they meant exactly, but I do know that he was the first, but not the last, Pirahã I saw who had been ostracized. Another effective form of ostracism, much less dramatic but more common, is to exclude someone from food sharing for a while. Such exclusion can last for a day or a few days, but rarely longer. I had many men come to me to say that so-and-so was mad at them for one reason or another so they couldn’t use a canoe to fish, or that no one would share with them. They next either asked me to intervene, which I did not, or asked for food, which I often gave them, trying to avoid any impression of getting involved in a village dispute. Spirits can tell the village what it should not have done or what it should not do. Spirits can single out individuals or simply talk to the group as a whole. Pirahãs listen carefully and often follow the exhortations of the kaoáíbógí. A spirit might say something like “Don’t want Jesus. He is not Pirahã,” or “Don’t hunt downriver tomorrow,” or things that are commonly shared values, such as “Don’t eat snakes.” Through spirits, ostracism, food-sharing regulation, and so on, Pirahã society disciplines itself. It has very little coercion by the standards of many other societies, but it seems to have just enough to control its members’ aberrant behavior.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"And then there is musical speech, one of the two communication channels that the Pirahãs have special names for. They refer to musical speech as “jaw going” or “jaw leaving.” It is produced by exaggerating the relative pitch differences between high tone and low tone and changing the rhythm of words and phrases to produce something like a melody. This channel has perhaps the most interesting array of functions in the language. It is used to communicate important new information. It is used to communicate with spirits (and often it is used by the kaoáíbógí, or spirits, themselves). But it is mainly used when the people are dancing. Interestingly, though I have no explanation for this fact, when I ask Pirahã to repeat something in musical speech, women produce it less self-consciously than do the men. Whistle speech, which the Pirahãs refer to as talking with a “sour mouth” or a “puckered mouth”—the same description they use of the mouth when sucking a lemon—is used only by men. For some reason, this restriction to men is true of most other languages with whistle speech. It is used to communicate while hunting and in aggressive play between boys.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"It turns out that for the Pirahãs the universe is like a layer cake, each layer marked by a boundary called bigí. There are worlds above the sky and worlds beneath the ground. I recognized this as similar, though not identical, to the beliefs of the Yanomami, who also believe in a layered universe. Just as bigí has a wider scope of meaning than I initially imagined possible, so did another major environmental term, xoí. Originally, I believed that xoí simply meant “jungle,” because that is its most common use. Then I realized that it in fact labels the entire space between bigís. That is, it can refer to “biosphere” or “jungle,” somewhat like our word earth, which can refer either to our planet or to just the soil on the planet’s surface. If you go into the jungle you say, “I am going into the xoí.” If you tell someone to remain motionless, as when sitting in a canoe or when a stinging insect lands on them, you say, “Don’t move in the xoí.” If it is a cloudless day you can say, “The xoí is pretty.” So the word is broader than merely “jungle.”","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"Sex and marriage also involve no ritual that I can see. Although Pirahãs are reluctant to discuss their own intimate sexual details, they have done so in general terms on occasion. They refer to cunnilingus and fellatio as “licking like dogs,” though this comparison to animal behavior is not intended to denigrate the act at all. They consider animals good examples of how to live. Sexual intercourse is described as eating the other. “I ate him” or “I ate her” means “I had sexual intercourse with him or her.” The Pirahãs quite enjoy sex and allude to it or talk about others’ sexual activity freely.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"Any baby who cuts, burns, or otherwise hurts itself gets scolded (and cared for too). And a mother will often answer a baby’s cry of pain in such circumstances with a growl of disgust, a low guttural “Ummm!” She might pick it up by an arm and angrily (but not violently) set it down abruptly away from the danger. But parents do not hug the child or say things like “Poor baby, I’m so sorry, let Mommy kiss it and make the boo-boo better.” The Pirahãs stare with surprise when they see non Pirahã mothers do this. They even think it is funny. “Don’t they want their children to learn to take care of themselves?” the Pirahãs ask me. But there is more to it than wanting children to become autonomous adults. The Pirahãs have an undercurrent of Darwinism running through their parenting philosophy. This style of parenting has the result of producing very tough and resilient adults who do not believe that anyone owes them anything. Citizens of the Pirahã nation know that each day’s survival depends on their individual skills and hardiness.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"That is meaning in a nutshell: the way a word or a sentence is used, the way it relates to other words and sentences, and what speakers agree that a word or a sentence points to in the world. And the Pirahãs, like all humans, mean things when they speak. But that doesn’t mean that we all use the same meanings. Like all humans, what Pirahãs mean when they talk is severely circumscribed by their values and beliefs. We learn, therefore, when we study words from any language, that we must understand each word at various levels simultaneously. We must understand a word’s cultural relevance and use. We must understand its sound structure. And we must understand how the word is used in context, in specific sentences and stories. Most linguists agree on these three levels of understanding the word. But Pirahã has also taught us something else. It has taught us that not only can the meaning of individual words be the result of culture, such as the closely related words for friend and enemy, but that the very sounds of the words, whether they are whistled, hummed, and so on, can themselves be determined by culture—and this latter lesson, which is abundantly illustrated in other languages, has not been discussed much in the linguistic literature. Pirahã gives us an extremely clear example for future linguistic investigations.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"The difficulty at the core of my reason for being among the Pirahãs was that the message that I had staked my life and career on did not fit the Pirahãs’ culture. At the very least, one lesson to draw here was that my confidence in the universal appeal of the spiritual message I was bringing was ill-founded. The Pirahãs were not in the market for a new worldview. And they could defend their own just fine. Had I taken the time to read about the Pirahãs before visiting them the first time, I would have learned that missionaries had been trying to convert them for over two hundred years. From the first record of contact with the Pirahãs and the Muras, a closely related people, in the eighteenth century, they had developed a reputation for “recalcitrance”—no Pirahãs are known to have “converted” at any period of their history. Not that this knowledge would have dissuaded me. Like all new missionaries, I was prepared to sweep aside mere facts and believe that my faith would ultimately overcome any obstacles. But the Pirahãs did not feel lost, so they didn’t feel a need to be “saved” either. The immediacy of experience principle means that if you haven’t experienced something directly, your stories about it are largely irrelevant. This renders them relatively impermeable to missionary efforts based on stories of the long-ago past that no one alive has witnessed. And this explains why they have resisted missionaries for so long. Creation myths are no match for this demand for evidence.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"The Pirahãs have no way of knowing that Westerners expect to live nearly twice as long as they do. And we not only expect to live longer, we consider it our right to do so. Americans in particular lack the Pirahãs’ stoicism. It isn’t that the Pirahãs are indifferent to death. A Pirahã father would paddle for days for help if he thought he could save a child. I have been awakened in the middle of the night by Pirahã men with desperate looks asking me to come right away to help a sick child or a sick spouse. The pain and concern on their faces are as deep as any I have ever seen. But I have never seen a Pirahã act as though the rest of the world had a duty to help him in his need or that it was necessary to suspend normal daily activities just because someone is sick or dying. This is not callousness. This is practicality.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"Eventually, I realized that this term referred to what I call experiential liminality, the act of just entering or leaving perception, that is, a being on the boundaries of experience. A flickering flame is a flame that repeatedly comes and goes out of experience or perception. This translation “worked”—it successfully explained to me when it was appropriate to use the word xibipíío (and a useful working translation is the best a researcher can hope for in this type of monolingual situation). The word xibipíío therefore reinforced and gave a positive face to the pervasive Pirahã value I had been working on independently. That value seemed to be to limit most talk to what you had seen or heard from an eyewitness.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"the Pirahãs are individualistic with regard to their own and their family’s survival. They and their family come first. They won’t let another Pirahã starve to death or suffer if they can help, but the person receiving help has to obviously need it—to be suffering from some physical ailment or to be too young or old to care for himself and to be able to be helped (not considered too far gone to help, for example). Otherwise, each one carries his own load. If a man cannot provide food and shelter for his wife and children, his family will likely abandon him for a better provider. If a woman is lazy and won’t get firewood, manioc from the jungle garden, or nuts from the forest, she will be left, at least as soon as her age begins to erase her beauty or fertility. But there is still a sense of belonging that permeates the values of all Pirahãs. The Pirahãs see immediately that outsiders lack this quality. They see Brazilians cheat and mistreat other Brazilians. They see American parents spank their children. Most puzzling to them, they have heard that Americans fight huge battles to kill large numbers of other peoples and that Americans and Brazilians even kill other Americans and Brazilians.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"From the time we are born we try to simplify the world around us. For it is too complicated for us to navigate; there are too many sounds, too many sights, too many stimuli for us to take even a single step unless we can decide what to pay attention to and what to ignore. In specific intellectual domains we call our attempts at simplification “hypotheses” and “theories.” Scientists invest their careers and energies in certain attempts at simplification. They request money from funding organizations to travel to or to build some new environment in which to test their simplifying scheme. But this type of “elegance theorizing” (getting results that are “pretty” rather than particularly useful) began to satisfy me less and less. People who contribute to such programs usually see themselves as working toward a closer relationship to truth. But as the American pragmatist philosopher and psychologist William James reminded us, we shouldn’t take ourselves too seriously. We are no more nor less than evolved primates. It is rather ridiculous to think that the universe is a virgin saving herself for us. We are all too often the three blind men describing an elephant; or the man who looks on the wrong side of the road for his keys, simply because the light is better there. The Pirahãs are firmly committed to the pragmatic concept of utility. They don’t believe in a heaven above us, or a hell below us, or that any abstract cause is worth dying for. They give us an opportunity to consider what a life without absolutes, like righteousness or holiness and sin, could be like. And the vision is appealing.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"Another edge to the Pirahãs’ challenge was my growing respect for them. There was so much about them that I admired. They were a sovereign people. And they were in effect telling me to peddle my goods elsewhere. They were telling me that my message had no purchase among them. All the doctrines and faith I had held dear were a glaring irrelevancy in this culture. They were superstition to the Pirahãs. And they began to seem more and more like superstition to me. I began to seriously question the nature of faith, the act of believing in something unseen. Religious books like the Bible and the Koran glorified this kind of faith in the nonobjective and counterintuitive—life after death, virgin birth, angels, miracles, and so on. The Pirahãs’ values of immediacy of experience and demand for evidence made all of this seem deeply dubious. Their own beliefs were not in the fantastic and miraculous but in spirits that were in fact creatures of their environment, creatures that did normal kinds of things (whether or not I thought they were real). There was no sense of sin among the Pirahãs, no need to “fix” mankind or even themselves. There was acceptance for things the way they are, by and large. No fear of death. Their faith was in themselves. This was not the first time I had questioned my faith. Brazilian intellectuals, my own hippie background, and a lot of reading had already raised doubts. But the Pirahãs were the last straw.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"In English punctuation, a period is used to mark falling pitch, while the question mark indicates rising pitch. When pitch is used to distinguish the meanings of sentences in this way, it is called intonation. There are many variations of intonation possible. To see just a glimpse of complexity in English’s use of pitch and stress, consider one of my favorite examples, known among linguists as “stress clash override.” When uttered alone, the word thirteen has higher pitch on the last syllable—“thirTEEN.” And the word women has higher pitch on the first syllable, “Women.” But put the two words together and what do you get? You don’t get “thirTEEN Women,” you get “THIRteen Women.” Why?Because English, like several other languages, doesn’t like two high-pitched, or accented, syllables next to each other. It prefers to have an alternating pattern—ACCENTED nonaccented ACCENTED nonaccented, and so on. So speakers of English change the accent on words like thirteen when they precede and modify other words, in order to get the result of alternating accents while at the same time maintaining the accent on the main word of the phrase, in this case the noun women in the noun phrase THIRteen Women. And no English-speaking child ever had to be taught this pattern of accents! They just do it. Figuring out how this is possible is one of the puzzles that make linguistics fun.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"Whatever else might be responsible for the Pirahãs’ lack of acquiring the skill of counting, I believe that one crucial factor is that they ultimately do not value Portuguese (or American) knowledge. In fact, they actively oppose some aspects of it coming into their lives. They ask questions about outside cultures largely for the entertainment value of the answers. If one tries to suggest, as we originally did, in a math class, that there is actually a preferred response to a specific question, this is unwelcome and will likely result in a change of conversational topic or simple irritation.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"But if all Pirahã myths must exemplify immediacy of experience, then the scriptures of many world religions, such as the Bible, the Koran, the Vedas, and so on, could not be translated or discussed among the Pirahãs, because they involve stories for which there is no living eyewitness. This is the main reason that no missionary for nearly three hundred years has had any impact on the Pirahãs’ religion. The stories of the Abrahamic religions lack living eyewitnesses, at least as I practiced religion when I was religious.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"This was wonderful. In a few short steps I had learned the words for crooked and straight. I had already learned the words for most body parts by this time. As we walked along, I remembered the words that had been given to me by the Pirahãs in their language for Pirahã people (Híaitíihí), Pirahã language (xapaitíisí), foreigner (xaoói), and foreign language (xapai gáisi). Pirahã language was clearly a combination of xapaí (head) and tii (straight), plus the suffix -si, which indicates that the word it is attached to is a name or a proper noun: “straight head.”Pirahã people was hi (he), ai (is), and tii (straight), plus -hi, another marker similar to -si: “he is straight.” Foreigner meant “fork,” as in “fork in the tree branch.” And foreign language meant “crooked head.”","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"For the Pirahãs, like all of us, knowledge is experience interpreted through culture and individual psyches. Knowledge requires eye witness testimony for the Pirahãs, but they do not subject this testimony to “peer review.” If I entered the village to report seeing a bat with a twenty-foot wingspan, most wouldn’t immediately believe me. But they might go look for themselves just to check it out. And if I were to report seeing a jaguar turn into a man, they would ask where, when, and how this happened. There is in principle no higher authority than my eyewitness account. This does not mean that one cannot lie. Lying is common among the Pirahãs, frankly, just as in all societies (it has useful evolutionary functions, such as protecting oneself and one’s family). Nevertheless, knowledge is the explanation of one’s own experiences, the explanation that one considers most useful. In this sense, the Pirahãs’ attitude toward knowledge, truth, and God is similar to the philosophy of pragmatism that emerges from the writings of William James, C. S. Peirce, and others—itself influenced by North American indigenous peoples’ concept of tolerance of physical and cultural differences. The Pirahãs and pragmatism share the idea that the test of knowledge is not whether it is true but whether it is useful. They want to know what they need to know in order to act. And the knowledge to act is based mainly on cultural conceptions of useful actions, of which theories are a part. So culture is helpful to us when we are in the locale where the culture developed.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"The Apurinã experience illustrates the dark side of Pirahã culture. While the Pirahãs are very tolerant and peaceful to one another, they can be violent in keeping others out of their land. It also shows us once again that tolerance toward a group of outsiders and coexistence with them does not mean long-term acceptance. The Apurinãs had believed that a lifetime among another people could overcome the differences in culture and society that separated them from this other people. They learned the deadly lesson that these barriers are nearly impossible to overcome, in spite of appearances over time—just as residents of the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, and many other places have learned in the course of history. But there is another lesson to take away from this story. It concerns the fate of Túkaaga himself. Just a few months after murdering Joaquim and attempting to murder Tomé, Túkaaga was living alone, away from all other Pirahã villages. A month or so after his isolation, he was dead in mysterious circumstances (meaning that the Pirahãs by and large did not want to talk about it—some said he died of a “cold,”which is possible). I think he may have been killed by fellow Pirahãs. All the Pirahãs felt eventually endangered by what Túkaaga had done, after police came to investigate Joaquim’s death. And the Pirahãs had heard rumblings that nearby settlers were considering a punitive attack against them. Initially, the Pirahãs told me that they were not afraid, though it was obvious to me that they were, in spite of their bravado. They realized as they talked more about the reaction against them for Joaquim’s murder that in fact many Pirahãs could die. This may be why Túkaaga was ostracized. Ostracization is an extreme form of punishment in the Amazon, where social cooperation is necessary for protection, for help in hunting and gathering food, and so on.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

If someone catches fish at 3 a.m., then that is when it will be eaten. Everyone will get up to eat as soon as it is brought in. ... Gathering and fishing together, then, takes about fifty-two hours per week, divided among father, mother, and children (and grandparents on occasion), so that no one needs to spend more than fifteen to twenty hours per week “working”—though these activities are enjoyable to the Pirahãs and hardly fit any Western concept of labor.","Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle (Vintage Departures)",Daniel L.

"As I discuss intergroup competition, keep in mind that there are many other cultural evolutionary forces that do not favor prosocial institutions.

"In Haifa, day care centers wanted to get parents to pick up their children on time. At six of these centers, fines were imposed on late parents, following typical prescriptions from economics. If people respond to incentives, then fewer parents should come late if they will be fined. In response, the rate of late parents doubled. Twelve weeks later, when the fine was revoked, parents still kept picking up their children just as late and did not return to the pre-fine levels. That is, the fine made things a lot worse. Adding a fine had apparently changed the implicit social norm, making arriving late merely something that could be purchased with a fee instead of a violation of an interpersonal social obligation that induces shame, embarrassment, or empathy for the staff. I suspect a better approach would have been to go the other way: reinforcing the interpersonal obligation with an explicit social norm and enriching the relationship between the parents and day-care staff.19","The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter",Joseph Henrich,B00WY4OXAS,,yellow,,location,6346,2019-03-28 04:56:00+00:00

"Finally, my undergraduates sometimes ask me if human evolution has stopped or reversed. Their intuition is that natural selection operates on our genes to better adapt individuals to survive in their environments. Since the products of recent cultural evolution now permit us to cure once-deadly infectious diseases, fix once-disabling torn knee ligaments, and artificially inseminate once-infertile couples, natural selection somehow isn’t acting to better adapt us to the “natural world,” the world without culture. The answer is, of course, that natural selection certainly has not stopped; it has merely changed direction. This, however, is not something new. To throw this question into stark relief, realize that Early Homo or Homo erectus could have asked the same question. These apes were gradually losing their big teeth, powerful jaw muscles, and large digestive systems while they were becoming addicted to high-quality foods and food-processing technologies, which required the know-how to find tubers and involved manufactured cutting tools and, at some point, fire and cooking. Some precocious erectus, with the same confusion as some of my students, might have worried that natural selection had stopped or reversed because stone tools and fire were now doing the work that their powerful jaw muscles and big teeth once did. The effect of culture on human genetic evolution is not new. Cultural evolution is just, once again, sending our species’ genetic evolution off in some new direction, down a coevolutionary alley that no other species has yet experienced.","The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter",Joseph Henrich,B00WY4OXAS,,yellow,,location,6295,2019-03-28 04:56:00+00:00

However, the key to understanding the division of labor is to recognize that it’s rooted in a division of information. As cultural information begins to accumulate such that no one individual can know everything, pair-bonded couples can specialize in complementary bodies of culturally acquired skills, practices, and knowledge. Female hunter-gatherers, by virtue of birthing, lactating, and providing primary care for babies, need to focus on learning about infant handling, nursing, weaning, food preparation and processing, and any foraging skills that guarantee a steady flow of calories.

"As in the small-scale societies seen in earlier chapters, the social world faced by our Paleolithic ancestors would have been increasingly shaped by the emergence of an immense variety of norms, and by the selective spread of specific norms packaged in institutions, that fostered success in intergroup competition. From the gene’s-eye view, survival and reproduction would have increasingly depended on the abilities of one’s bearer (the individual) to acquire and navigate a social landscape governed by culturally transmitted local rules—those appropriate to whatever group a particular gene happened to find itself in. Typically, in small-scale societies, as in many communities, the sanctioning of norm violators begins with gossip and public criticism, often through joking by specific relatives (as with Kula), and then intensifies to damage marital prospects and reduce access to trading and exchange partners. If violators are still not brought into line, matters may escalate to ostracism or physical violence (e.g., beatings) and occasionally culminate in coordinated group executions.2 In parallel with how wolves were domesticated into dogs by killing those that wouldn’t obey and refused to be trained, human communities domesticated their members.3","The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter",Joseph Henrich,B00WY4OXAS,,yellow,,location,3673,2019-03-22 04:56:00+00:00

"Consider two very large prehuman populations, the Geniuses and the Butterflies. Suppose the Geniuses will devise an invention once in 10 lifetimes. The Butterflies are much dumber, only devising the same invention once in 1000 lifetimes. So, this means that the Geniuses are 100 times smarter than the Butterflies. However, the Geniuses are not very social and have only 1 friend they can learn from. The Butterflies have 10 friends, making them 10 times more social. Now, everyone in both populations tries to obtain an invention, both by figuring it out for themselves and by learning from friends. Suppose learning from friends is difficult: if a friend has it, a learner only learns it half the time. After everyone has done their own individual learning and tried to learn from their friends, do you think the innovation will be more common among the Geniuses or the Butterflies? Well, among the Geniuses a bit fewer than 1 out of 5 individuals (18%) will end up with the invention. Half of those Geniuses will have figured it out all by themselves. Meanwhile, 99.9% of Butterflies will have the innovation, but only 0.1% will have figured it out by themselves.

"In class, I show my undergraduates unlabeled pictures of four different stone toolkits from (1) eighteenth-century Tasmanians, (2) seventeenth-century Australian Aborigines, (3) Neanderthals, and (4) late Paleolithic modern-looking humans (30,000 years ago). I ask them to assess the cognitive abilities of the toolmakers by looking at the tools. Remember, there are no names or dates, only images of stone tools. My students always rate the Tasmanians and Neanderthals as less cognitively sophisticated than both the seventeenth-century Australian Aborigines and the late Paleolithic toolmakers. Of course, there’s no reason to suspect any innate cognitive differences between Tasmanians and Aborigines, who only became separate populations after the Bass Strait flooded. Unfortunately, no one raises their hand to suggest that, actually, it’s not possible to infer innate cognitive abilities from tool complexity because of the importance of sociality in generating tool complexity (that’s the correct answer). To sharpen this point, consider whether the Polar Inuit of 1820 were smarter than the Polar Inuit of 1860? In 1820, they could make kayaks, fancy fishing spears, and compound bows. In 1860, they could not.","The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter",Joseph Henrich,B00WY4OXAS,,yellow,,location,4374,2019-03-22 04:56:00+00:00
"As an English speaker, you have 11 basic color terms at your disposal because cultural evolution has figured out how to make them learnable. Meanwhile, Korean speakers have 14 color terms. However, most societies over human evolutionary history probably only had two or three color terms. Learning additional color terms influences our cognitive abilities and increases our gray matter, improving our discrimination and memory for different color shades across terminological boundaries at the expense of shades within the boundaries of one term. Of course, if you have more nonoverlapping terms, you have more terminological boundaries.16","The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter",Joseph Henrich,B00WY4OXAS,,yellow,,location,4700,2019-03-22 04:56:00+00:00
"Many of the products of cumulative cultural evolution give us not only ready concepts to apply to somewhat new problems, and concepts to recombine (bows are projectiles + elastically stored energy), but actually give us cognitive tools or mental abilities that we would otherwise not have. Arabic numbers, Roman letters, the Indian zero, the Gregorian calendar, cylindrical projection maps, basic color terms, clocks, fractions, and right versus left are just a few of the cognitive tools that have shaped your mind and mine. These have evolved culturally to “fit” the mental constraints imposed by the genes that build our brains by harnessing, enhancing, and recombining our innate capacities to develop new and unexpected abilities. To see what I mean, consider the abacus, a tool that has not shaped the minds of most Westerners. Skilled abacus users can solve math problems, like 345 + 675 + 853, faster than calculator users. That’s impressive, but it’s really just one tool versus another. However, here’s the thing: skilled abacus users can also beat calculator users even when they are disarmed, without their abaci. That is, they can make purely mental calculations faster than calculator users; this is because the abacus evolved from counting boards, which date back to before the Babylonians, through a long process of selective cultural evolution. Analyses of the abacus suggest that it is optimized to the constraints and affordances of our visual perception and memory, making it easier for us to store numbers in visual working memory. Once fully trained, people, including young children, can do superfast mental arithmetic. They accomplish this by visualizing the abacus and often actually manipulate their fingers nonconsciously as if they were rapidly sliding the abacus beads around. Language appears to play little or no role in the calculation, except that at the end, people have to report their answers in Arabic numerals or their verbal equivalents. The approach abacus users take to mental arithmetic contrasts with that taken by typical Western undergraduates who, when facing the same challenge, lean heavily on their linguistic tools (number words). Thus, the abacus provides a mental prosthesis that, by harnessing aspects of our visual memory, can deliver mental powers that seem almost unimaginable to those unfamiliar with this simple but elegant tool.27","The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter",Joseph Henrich,B00WY4OXAS,,yellow,,location,4466,2019-03-22 04:56:00+00:00
"This view of cultural evolution underlines another point about technology and our species’ evolutionary history. It’s not a straight line. Researchers look for the earliest evidence of things like fire, spears, hafted weapons, fishhooks, jewelry, trade, bone tools, etc. and then all too often assume that, once invented, these persist forever, or at least until they are replaced by something better. The expected picture seems to be one of continuous, if often halting, technical progress. However, all the evidence I’ve presented so far indicates that the flourishing of technology and nonmaterial know-how will depend on the interaction of ecological conditions, environmental fluctuations, disease shocks, and social institutions. Groups can and will lose know-how and never get it back. Consider something as precious as bows and arrows. Current evidence suggests that bows and arrows may have emerged by 60–70,000 years ago in Africa, though some argue for a much earlier date. Meanwhile, at the time of European contact, there were no bows or arrows anywhere in Australia. An entire continent of hunter-gatherers relied on spears, throwing clubs, and boomerangs. We’ve already seen that the Dorset lost their archery expertise, which cost them when the Inuit arrived. Bows and arrows were also lost in Oceania, perhaps several times. Like ocean-going boats and pottery, it turns out that the know-how to make and use bows and arrows is frequently lost by human groups. As previously noted, some foraging groups have even lost the know-how for starting a fire.22","The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter",Joseph Henrich,B00WY4OXAS,,yellow,,location,4420,2019-03-22 04:56:00+00:00
"By using puppet shows as simple morality plays, Kiley’s efforts reveal that infants prefer puppets who help others but don’t generally like those puppets who hinder or otherwise hurt others. Crucially, however, babies rapidly develop a key nuance: by eight months of age, babies prefer puppets who hurt previously antisocial persons (those spotted harming other puppets) over those who help antisocial types. Hurting others is fine according to babies, as long as those others are known to harm others or are members of other groups. Similarly, toddlers actively punish, by taking treats away from guys who help antisocial others; instead, they prefer puppets who hurt antisocial guys. This work shows that, early in development, babies already possess some of the key reputational and motivational elements that sustain social norms in small-scale societies and seem prepared to apply that reputational logic to simple circumstances of helping and hurting.21","The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter",Joseph Henrich,B00WY4OXAS,,yellow,,location,3894,2019-03-22 04:56:00+00:00

"Taboos on particular game species or certain parts of animals for particular categories of people are interesting because, to the learner, they appear to be facts about the world that can drive purely self-interested actions: I want to avoid illness, and certain animal parts will cause me to get sick, so I’d best not eat those. Crucially, such beliefs induce sharing in a community without anyone realizing it. However, if such beliefs are inaccurate and costly to the individual, it’s sensible to ask why either individual experience or rules like “copy the successful” would not result in the eventual disappearance of such taboos. Three interrelated psychological factors work against this: 1.  There is reason to suspect that we humans have an innate susceptibility to picking up meat aversions, due to the tendency of dead animals to carry dangerous pathogens.34 Thus, we humans are primed to acquire meat taboos over other food avoidances. 2.  These taboos are social norms, so violations will be monitored and judged by others. This factor is especially potent here because the punishment or misfortunes believed to result from taboo violations will (often) be felt by the whole band (e.g., hunting failures). 3.  A good learner will acquire this rule while growing up and never actually violate it (meat is consumed in public), so he’ll never directly experience eating the tabooed part and not having bad luck. Rare cases of taboo violations that, by coincidence, were followed by bad luck or illness will be readily remembered and passed on (psychologists call this “negativity bias”). Meanwhile, cases of violations followed by a long period when nothing bad happens will tend to be missed or forgotten, unless people keep and check accurate records. Based on my field experience, any skeptic who questions the taboos will be met with vivid descriptions of particular cases in which the taboos were violated and then poor hunting, illnesses, or bad luck ensued.35","The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter",Joseph Henrich,B00WY4OXAS,,yellow,,location,3126,2019-03-18 04:56:00+00:00

"Let me highlight three features of this case. First, the real causal links between many of these elements and pig production are unclear. Maybe singing does cause pigs to grow faster, but it’s not obvious, and no one tried to ascertain this fact, via experimentation for example. Second, the village leadership chose to rely on copying institutions from other groups and not on designing their own institutions from scratch. This is smart, since we humans are horrible at designing institutions from scratch. And third, this transmission between groups occurred rapidly because the Irakia already had a political institution in the village, which involved a council of the senior members of each clan, who were empowered by tradition (social norms) to make community-level decisions. Lacking such decision-making institution, Fore practices would have had to spread among households and thus been much slower in spreading. Of course, such political decision-making institutions themselves are favored by intergroup competition.","The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter",Joseph Henrich,B00WY4OXAS,,yellow,,location,3437,2019-03-18 04:56:00+00:00

"Psychologically powerful communal rituals like this one are common in small-scale societies and among mobile hunter-gatherers, from the central desert in Australia to the Great Basin in North America. Like Megan and Lorna, keen observers of human communities, such as the Muslim scholar Ibn Khaldûn in the fourteenth century, have argued that communal rituals have a potent psychological impact on their participants and create strong personal ties, deep trust, and a profound sense of group solidarity. Recently, however, researchers have begun to systematically measure the effect of communal rituals on social bonding and cooperation and to further break rituals down into their active ingredients. These ingredients include (1) synchronous singing and dancing or other movements (e.g., marching), (2) collaborative music making, (3) extreme physical exhaustion, (4) feelings of a common fate, (5) shared experiences of danger or terror, (6) supernatural or mystical beliefs, and (7) causal opacity or a lack of instrumentality (that is, people are not sure why the ritual must be done in a particular way, but they know it must be done in that way).40","The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter",Joseph Henrich,B00WY4OXAS,,yellow,,location,3164,2019-03-18 04:56:00+00:00
"Social norms make it possible for humans to solve—often without anyone understanding how—what would otherwise be inescapable social dilemmas. Social life is riddled with chances to exploit others, which most people don’t even notice. And the more individuals interact and trust each other, the greater the opportunities there are to exploit others—to cheat or free ride on the efforts of others. Culture has several tools and some secret tricks, but two are most important. First and foremost, it brings in third parties to monitor, reward, and sanction others based on local culturally transmitted and widely shared rules. When necessary, it incentivizes third-party actions in some way, often to sanction norm violators. Second, by providing mental models of situations and relationships, it directs our attention away from opportunities to exploit others and reframes situations in ways that tap or harness our instincts in distinct, and often prosocial, ways. Behaviors like smoking, eating horse meat, or littering can go from perfectly acceptable to disgusting, once new culturally transmitted mental connections are made. This is how, over tens of thousands of years, cultural evolution forged primate troops into human communities. Now, let’s take a deeper look at how social norms have shaped small-scale societies.","The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter",Joseph Henrich,B00WY4OXAS,,yellow,,location,2860,2019-03-15 04:56:00+00:00
"In exploring culture-gene coevolution so far, we’ve begun to see how effective cultural learning is for acquiring tastes for performing all manner of costly actions, including even food preferences that require overcoming our innate aversions, as we saw with chili peppers. Building on such empirical observations, evolutionary researchers have been using mathematical modeling tools to ask this question: what happens when people culturally learn from others, and then those acquired behaviors, strategies, beliefs, or motivations influence future social interactions? The answer from cultural evolutionary game theory is that social norms spontaneously emerge. Groups of individuals who engage in social interactions and learn from each other using cues like success and prestige often end up sharing similar behaviors, strategies, expectations, or preferences, and deviations from these shared standards are penalized or sanctioned in some way. Or, in some cases, individuals come to share standards for valuing uncommon excellence, for rewarding individuals for going above and beyond the standard. Either way, the resulting behavioral patterns are stable in the sense that they tend to endure and resist efforts by one or a few individuals to change them.6","The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter",Joseph Henrich,B00WY4OXAS,,yellow,,location,2835,2019-03-15 04:56:00+00:00

"Effective institutions often harness or suppress aspects of our status psychology in nonintuitive ways. Take the Great Sanhedrin, the ancient Jewish court and legislature that persisted for centuries at the beginning of the Common Era. When deliberating on a capital case, its seventy judges would each share their views, beginning with the youngest and lowest-ranking member and then proceed in turn to the “wisest” and most respected member. This is an interesting norm because (1) it’s nearly the opposite of how things would go if we let nature take its course, and (2) it helps guarantee that all the judges got to hear the least varnished views of the lower-ranking members, since otherwise the views of the lowest-status individuals would be tainted by both the persuasive and deferential effects of prestige and dominance. ... These customs are not something that smart people often just think up, and even when they do, such practices are hard to implement. This is so because the high-status members of such deliberative bodies tend believe their views deserve special attention and want the opportunity to speak first to increase their influence on outcomes. Converging with their colleagues, low-status members are often disinclined to speak first, out of a fear of looking ill informed or of contradicting the high-status individuals, who haven’t yet spoken. Thus, neither high- nor low-status individuals would necessarily be particularly supportive of a low-to-high-status speaking rule unless they understood something of status psychology and were more concerned about the institution’s long-term success than their personal influence and careers.","The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter",Joseph Henrich,B00WY4OXAS,,yellow,,location,2731,2019-03-14 04:56:00+00:00
"I’ll close this chapter with a lesson in leadership that reflects an intuitive grasp of prestige from the English explorer James Cook. In 1768, as Lieutenant Cook was preparing to depart for the South Pacific, scurvy continued to plague the British navy, as it had for centuries, killing many sailors. Scurvy symptoms start with spongy gums and a general malaise, which is followed by bleeding from the nose and mouth and the loss of teeth. If vitamin C is not consumed, this decline ends in death. On the suggestion of an English physician, Cook obtained a large supply of sauerkraut, which we now know will prevent scurvy. Since sauerkraut represented a rather pungent and unusual deviation from the traditional maritime fare, Cook worried that his sailors would refuse to eat it and knew that neither force nor education were likely to succeed in creating an enduring dietary shift. Instead, he ordered that plates of sauerkraut be dressed and served at the officers’ mess, but not at the sailors’ mess. Within a week of setting sail, inferring that the officers had a taste for sauerkraut, the rank-and-file crew began actively requesting servings of sauerkraut. Very quickly, sauerkraut became so desired that it had to be rationed. Cook finished his expedition with not a single case of scurvy, a feat theretofore unheard of among Europeans during such long ocean voyages.","The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter",Joseph Henrich,B00WY4OXAS,,yellow,,location,2754,2019-03-14 04:56:00+00:00

"To understand prestige as a social phenomenon, it’s crucial to realize that it’s often difficult to figure out what precisely makes someone successful. In modern societies, the success of a star NBA basketball player might arise from his (1) intensive practice in the off-season, (2) sneaker preference, (3) sleep schedule, (4) pregame prayer, (5) special vitamins, or (6) taste for carrots. Any or all of these might increase his success. A naïve learner can’t tell all the causal links between an individual’s practices and his success (see chapter 7). As a consequence, learners often copy their chosen models broadly across many domains. Of course, learners may place more weight on domains that for one reason or other seem more causally relevant to the model’s success. This copying often includes the model’s personal habits or styles as well as their goals and motivations, since these may be linked to their success. This “if in doubt, copy it” heuristic is one of the reasons why success in one domain converts to influence across a broad range of domains.6","The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter",Joseph Henrich,B00WY4OXAS,,yellow,,location,2357,2019-03-10 04:56:00+00:00

"What does race tell us about these genetic differences? Nothing. Traditional racial categories just don’t tell us anything about this important variation. In fact, the processes I’ve described above actually make classical racial categories even less informative, since they operate in diverse and nonconcordant ways within races to make local groups less similar (e.g., lactase persistent and nonpersistent Africans) while at the same time making different continental races more similar (e.g., amylase genes in Japanese and Americans).

"This set of taboos represents a cultural adaptation that selectively targets the most toxic species in women’s usual diets, just when mothers and their offspring are most susceptible. To explore how this cultural adaptation emerged, we studied both how women acquire these taboos and what kind of causal understandings they possess. As adolescents and young women, these taboos are first learned from mothers, mothers-in-law, and grandmothers. However, this initial repertoire is then updated by a substantial portion of women who learn more taboos from village elders and prestigious local yalewa vuku (wise women), who are known for being knowledgeable about birthing and medicinal plants. Here we see Fijian women using cues of age, success or knowledge, and prestige to figure out from whom to learn their taboos. As explained in earlier chapters, such selectivity alone is capable of generating an adaptive repertoire over generations, without anyone understanding anything. We also looked for a shared underlying mental model of why one would not eat these marine species during pregnancy or breastfeeding—a causal model or set of reasoned principles. Unlike the highly consistent answers on what not to eat and when, women’s responses to our why questions were all over the map. Many women simply said they did not know and clearly thought it was an odd question. Others said it was “custom.” Some did suggest that the consumption of at least some of the species might result in harmful effects to the fetus, but what precisely would happen to the fetus varied greatly, though a nontrivial segment of the women explained that babies would be born with rough skin if sharks were eaten and smelly joints if morays were eaten.","The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter",Joseph Henrich,B00WY4OXAS,,yellow,,location,1993,2019-03-08 04:56:00+00:00
"Traditionally, Naskapi hunters decided where to go to hunt using divination and believed that the shoulder bones of caribou could point the way to success.15 To start the ritual, the shoulder blade was heated over hot coals in a way that caused patterns of cracks and burnt spots to form. This patterning was then read as a kind of map, which was held in a prespecified orientation. The cracking patterns were (probably) essentially random from the point of view of hunting locations, since the outcomes depended on myriad details about the bone, fire, ambient temperature, and heating process. Thus, these divination rituals may have provided a crude randomizing device that helped hunters avoid their own decision-making biases. The undergraduates in the Matching Pennies game could have used a randomizing device like divination, though the chimps seem fine without it.16","The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter",Joseph Henrich,B00WY4OXAS,,yellow,,location,2078,2019-03-08 04:56:00+00:00
"Finally, we humans do, of course, construct causal models of how the world works. However, what’s often missed is that the construction of these models has long been sparked and fostered by the existence of complex culturally evolved products. When people have accurately speculated on why they do something, this realization often occurs after the fact: “Why do we always do it this way? There must be a reason.… Maybe it’s because …” However, just because some people have speculated accurately as why they themselves, or their groups, do something in a particular way does not mean that this is the reason why they do it. An enormous amount of scientific causal understanding, for example, has developed in trying to explain existing technologies, like the steam engine, hot air balloon, or airplane. A device or technology often preexisted the development of any causal understanding, but by existing, such cultural products opened a window on the world that facilitated the development of an improved causal understanding. That is, for much of human history until recently, cumulative cultural evolution drove the emergence of deeper causal understandings much more than causal understanding drove cultural evolution.31","The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter",Joseph Henrich,B00WY4OXAS,,yellow,,location,2231,2019-03-08 04:56:00+00:00
"This example makes a key point: not only do people often not understand what their cultural practices are doing, but sometimes it may even be important that they don’t understand what their practices are doing or how they work. If people came to understand that bird augury or bone divination didn’t actually predict the future, the practice would probably be dropped or people would increasingly ignore ritual findings in favor of their own intuitions.","The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter",Joseph Henrich,B00WY4OXAS,,yellow,,location,2104,2019-03-08 04:56:00+00:00
"Note, if you are educated and Western, you might be thinking that my numerous examples of toxic plants and animals are merely special cases, because you might be under the impression that few plants need detoxification and that nature’s bounty is pure and safe. For many Westerners, “it’s natural” seems to mean “it’s good.” This view is wrong and comes from shopping in supermarkets and living in landscaped environments. Plants evolved toxins to deter animals, fungi, and bacteria from eating them. The list of “natural” foods that need processing to detoxify them goes on and on. Early potatoes were toxic, and the Andean peoples ate clay to neutralize the toxin. Even beans can be toxic without processing. In California, many hunter-gatherer populations relied on acorns, which, similar to manioc, require a labor intensive, multiday leaching process. Many small-scale societies have similarly exploited hardy, tropical plants called cycads for food. But cycads contain a nerve toxin. If not properly processed, they can cause neurological symptoms, paralysis, and death. Numerous societies, including hunter-gatherers, have culturally evolved an immense range of detoxification techniques for cycads.","The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter",Joseph Henrich,B00WY4OXAS,,yellow,,location,2052,2019-03-08 04:56:00+00:00

"Crucially, these populations must also have persisted with herding and milking but not have adopted the practices, or culturally evolved the know-how, for turning milk into cheese, yogurt, and kumis. Kumis is a fermented beverage made from mare’s milk. While fresh whole milk from cows is 4.6% lactose by weight, cheddar cheese is 0.1%, and tzatziki is 0.3% (tzatziki is a traditional Middle Eastern yogurt-based dish). Some fancy cheeses like Gouda and Brie have only trace amounts of lactose. Thus, cheese and yogurt making are, at least in part, cultural adaptations for reducing lactose, which permit everyone to access much of the otherwise unavailable nutrition from milk. If populations had developed these bodies of technical know-how too soon, the selection pressure on genes for doing the same job would have been weakened. Thus, understanding who is, and is not, lactase persistent requires understanding both how cultural evolution can drive, and how it can inhibit, genetic evolution.","The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter",Joseph Henrich,B00WY4OXAS,,yellow,,location,1785,2019-03-07 04:56:00+00:00

"Though these patterns of thinking are quite consistent across diverse small-scale societies, it’s worth noting that Western, urban populations appear to have some anomalies in their folkbiological psychology. In small-scale societies, people typically use, and children first learn, focal categories (see figure 5.4) like “robin,” “wolf,” and “chimpanzee.” But the urban-living children and university students that psychologists typically study use what are called “life-form-level” categories, such as “bird” and “fish.” Moreover, these urbanites seem to preferentially reason from what they know about humans to other species, rather than just positioning humans within the taxonomy and treating them like any other animal. Comparative studies with Maya children, as well as Americans living in rural areas, have suggested why: urban children receive very little cultural input on plants and animals; thus, the only critters they know much about are humans. In essence, urbanized Western folkbiological systems are malfunctioning due to a poverty of input during cognitive development.30","The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter",Joseph Henrich,B00WY4OXAS,,yellow,,location,1619,2019-03-07 04:56:00+00:00

"Particularly interesting in this case is that natural selection found different ways to create lactase persistence in different populations. It appears that as herding animals became a centerpiece of economies around Eurasia and Africa, natural selection independently found five different genetic variants to suppress the shutdown of lactase production in different populations. In Europe, there was a flip on chromosome 2 just a short distance upstream from the gene that codes for the protein lactase (LCT). The DNA base cytosine got swapped for thymine. This flip may simply have thrown a monkey wrench into the otherwise mammalian standard “off switch” for the making of lactase proteins after weaning. Elsewhere, in Africa and the Middle East, the DNA swaps are different, though they are all between 13,000 and 15,000 bases upstream from LCT.11","The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter",Joseph Henrich,B00WY4OXAS,,yellow,,location,1802,2019-03-07 04:56:00+00:00
"Natural selection would have operated on many different genes to favor very light skin among cereal-eating Baltic peoples, because there are many genetic routes to reduce melanin in our skin. One of those genes is called HERC2 which is located on chromosome 15. HERC2 inhibits, or suppresses, the production of a protein by a nearby gene called OCA2. Suppression of the synthesis of this protein, which occurs through a long and complicated set of biochemical pathways, results in less melanin in people’s skin. However, unlike other genes that influence skin color at other places in those pathways, HERC2 usually causes light eyes because it also reduces the melanin in irises. Blue and green eyes, then, are a side effect of natural selection favoring genes for lighter skin among cereal-dependent populations living at high latitudes. If cultural evolution hadn’t produced agriculture, and specifically techniques and technologies suitable for higher latitudes, then there would be no blue or green eyes.3 In all likelihood then, this genetic variant only started spreading within the last six millennia, after agriculture arrived in the Baltic region.","The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter",Joseph Henrich,B00WY4OXAS,"Interesting, but contradicted by dark skinned, blue eyes Cheddar Man?",yellow,,location,1698,2019-03-07 04:56:00+00:00

"The difference in the results from each version surprised the economists who designed the experiment (though, admittedly, many economists are pretty easily surprised by human behavior6). Three patterns are striking. First, the MBAs didn’t use the additional information available in the second treatment (with posted performances) in the complex and sophisticated way economic theory assumes. Instead, careful analysis shows that many participants were merely copying (“mimicking”) the investment allocations made by the top performers in the previous round. Second, the environment of this experiment is simple enough that one can actually calculate the profit-maximizing investment allocations. This optimal allocation can be compared with where participants actually ended up in round 16 for each of the two versions. Left only to their own individual experience, the MBAs ended up very far away from the optimal allocation—thus, poor overall performance. However, in the second treatment, when they mimicked each other’s investments, the group zeroed in on the optimal allocation by the end of the game. Here, the whole group made more money, which is interesting since there were no incentives for group performance, as grade assignments were all based on relative rankings. Finally, while opportunities to imitate each other had a dramatic effect on improving the overall group performance, it also led to some individual catastrophes. Sometimes top performers had taken large risks, which paid off in the short run—they got lucky. But their risky allocations, which often included massive borrowing, were copied by others.

"Aspiring young hunters first glean as much as they can from those to whom they have ready access, like their brothers, fathers, and uncles. Later, perhaps during adolescence, learners update and improve their earlier efforts by focusing on and learning from the older, most successful, and most prestigious hunters in their community. That is, learners should use three cultural learning cues to target their learning: age, success, and prestige.

"Putting it all together, here is what I think is going on: there seems to be two fruitful reproductive strategies available to males—either through success in the linear male dominance hierarchy, winning conflicts with other males to increase access to fertile females, or through maintaining a strong bond with their (preferably high ranked) mother, which increases male access to fertile females. You might think that middle status males would join together to overthrow the disproportionately successful alpha, but consider the cost: they’d be reducing the time spent with their mothers, and by extension in the vicinity of oestrous females, to develop a same-sex coalition with no guarantee of success.

"When I’m in a group that’s discussing an important issue, I actually like to go one step further. Whether or not I’m chairing the meeting, I suggest that everyone—even those who’ve already spoken—answer a thought-provoking question, such as: “If there were something we were missing here, what would it be?” “If there were a completely different way to see this, what would it be?” “If there were one thing that worried you about this, what would it be?”",How to Have a Good Day: Harness the Power of Behavioral Science to Transform Your Working Life,Caroline Webb,B00X2F7RPG,,yellow,favorite,location,3652,2018-10-15 04:56:00+00:00
"Writing it down. Write a sentence or two about how you’re feeling, and what’s causing those feelings (“I feel irritated/upset/let down right now because…”). You might also want to refer back to the list of common triggers in Chapter 9, to see if it helps you to label what’s causing your feelings. Then review what you’ve written, without judging it. Finally, ask yourself, “Now what’s the right thing to do?” Structured venting. If you find it helpful to talk to co-workers or friends about what’s winding you up, ask them to hold back on giving advice until you’ve articulated what you’re feeling and what’s causing that feeling. It’s not hard to do this informally by simply saying: “Can I just get this off my chest?” With a close friend, you might be even more explicit: “I don’t need you to solve anything just yet. I just need you to nod and say, ‘How terrible.’ ” Calling it out. Next time you’re in a meeting where tension is obvious, try saying out loud: “This is feeling tough right now, isn’t it? What can we do differently?” It’s almost inevitable that the group will give a collective sigh of relief as your acknowledgment allows everyone’s brain to calm down. And you’ll be much better able to move forward from that point.",How to Have a Good Day: Harness the Power of Behavioral Science to Transform Your Working Life,Caroline Webb,B00X2F7RPG,,yellow,,location,4879,2018-10-15 04:56:00+00:00
"With that in mind, what can you do to see your challenge from a completely different angle? Here are some specific things to try: Write in longhand. Take a notebook and pen, and start writing down your thoughts about the issue. Most of us do this so rarely that it’s a quick way of getting into a different state of mind and allowing novel connections to form. Set a timer and write for ten minutes. If you run out of steam, it’s okay—just ask yourself what else you have to say about the topic, and wait till something else comes to mind. It always does. Explain your issue to someone else. If you’ve spent a while wrestling with an idea, try explaining what you’re doing to someone else. In software engineering, this process is sometimes called “rubber ducking” because even explaining your work to an inanimate object (such as a rubber duck) is a reliable way of reaching new insight. It works because articulating your thoughts in conversation activates different neural networks than solo thinking does. Explaining what you’re doing to someone who’s not an expert in your field can also require you to use metaphors or examples, which in turn can encourage new thoughts.",How to Have a Good Day: Harness the Power of Behavioral Science to Transform Your Working Life,Caroline Webb,B00X2F7RPG,,yellow,,location,3389,2018-10-15 04:56:00+00:00

"You can’t know for sure when the next curveball is going to come your way. But you can do some preparation to make sure you have “stay cool” techniques ready for the next time it happens. Practice with whatever is most bothering you at the moment. Label it. Write down how you feel about this situation, and why. Get some distance. Try: talking to yourself in the second person, addressing yourself as “you”; looking back from the future; wearing someone else’s shoes, perhaps those of your “best self”; imagining you’re advising a friend. Ask a rewarding question. • Ask: “How fascinating! What can I learn from this?” • Think of a crucible moment, where you overcame a challenge in the past. Ask: “What qualities allowed me to overcome that? What does that tell me about my ability to improve this situation?” • Ask: “What am I really trying to achieve? How can I refocus on that?” Do some diaphragmatic breathing. Get used to the unfamiliar sensation of your lungs being truly full. Repeat a few times and notice the effects. Master the unknown.

"When you need a flash of inspiration on a thorny topic, try the following: Pose a question. When you’re feeling blocked, ask yourself: “What would be a totally different approach to this?” “What would be a great way of going about solving this?” “If I knew the answer, what would it be?” Refresh and reboot. Try shifting your focus to a different type of task for a while, before returning to the original issue. Switch views. Try a different way of describing or looking at the issue you’re working on, and notice what patterns or insights come to the surface: • Write about it in longhand for ten minutes. • “Rubber duck” it: explain the issue to someone unfamiliar with it. • Create a physical map of your issue, e.g. using sticky notes. Find an analogy. Expose yourself to a different type of stimulus (e.g. observe another organization’s ways of working; view websites or images from fields different from yours), and ask yourself: How is this like the topic I’m working on?

"A good first step toward making smarter choices is to become adept at recognizing when your automatic system may be taking charge. In my experience, if you catch yourself saying or thinking anything like the following phrases, then the chances are that your automatic system is trumping your deliberate system: “It’s obviously right (or obviously wrong).” “I recently heard XYZ…therefore…” “Everyone agrees.” “I understand it—so I like it!” “Let’s just stick with what we know.” “There’s only one real option.”",How to Have a Good Day: Harness the Power of Behavioral Science to Transform Your Working Life,Caroline Webb,B00X2F7RPG,,yellow,,location,3475,2018-10-15 04:56:00+00:00
"In the workplace, we discuss topics that are far more subtle than the length of a line. So our tendency toward groupthink is harder to spot; it can easily look as if we’re simply part of a team that’s harmoniously on the same page. In her book Mindset, Stanford professor Carol Dweck recounts a story about Alfred P. Sloan, once the CEO of General Motors, and a leader who knew groupthink when he saw it. When addressing a group that seemed happily aligned on the right thing to do, he said: “I take it we are all in complete agreement on the decision here…. Then I propose we postpone further discussion of this matter until our next meeting, to give ourselves time to develop disagreement and perhaps gain some understanding of what the decision is all about.”8",How to Have a Good Day: Harness the Power of Behavioral Science to Transform Your Working Life,Caroline Webb,B00X2F7RPG,,yellow,,location,3553,2018-10-15 04:56:00+00:00

"Think about the item on your to-do list that you’ve been avoiding for a while. (If you don’t have one, please take a bow, and skip to the next chapter.) Picture the benefits. What will be better as a result of getting this done, for you and for others? How great will that feel? Think back to the last time you got something like this done—what was the upside? Plan a short-term reward. How could you plan to reward yourself for today’s progress toward the end goal, if it’s a long haul? Tie the first step to something you like. Identify the first small step you need to take. Then find a way to link that to something you are definitely going to do today and that you enjoy doing. Amplify the downside of inaction. How can you sharpen your sense of the costs of not getting it done? What pre-commitments can you make, ideally involving other people? Ask the five whys.

"Step 1: Describe the other person’s point of view as if you really like it. Be as compelling and generous as you can. The philosopher Daniel Dennett once put it like this: “You should attempt to re-express your target’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, ‘Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.’ ” Step 2: Identify all the things you agree on. Recognizing the areas where you do agree, even if they’re few, will help build a sense of in-group. Get the ball rolling with your own suggestions, then make it a collaborative effort by asking: “What else do we both believe to be true?” Step 3: Isolate and understand the true disagreement. Define precisely where you differ. Then go deeper by asking: “Why do we each feel or think differently about this specific issue?” Surfacing the experience or assumptions that shape your perspectives helps you understand the nature of your respective “gorillas.” You may even learn from each other. Step 4: Explore how both of you could be correct. Now, you may “agree to disagree”; it feels easier to do that once you can see where you’re aligned and why you disagree. But you can also ask: “Is there any way that both of our perspectives could be somehow correct?” It’s often the case that you’re each partially right—but perhaps in different situations or circumstances. Step 5: What can you do now, based on your common ground? There’s always something. And the prospect of progress will help both of you feel good, making it easier to resolve or accept whatever is left on the table.",How to Have a Good Day: Harness the Power of Behavioral Science to Transform Your Working Life,Caroline Webb,B00X2F7RPG,,yellow,,location,2500,2018-10-15 04:56:00+00:00
"For your next conversation where rapport is important: Set collaborative intentions. Set intentions that focus on improving the quality of the relationship, not on your agenda. Check your negative assumptions. Decide to find the other person interesting. Ask quality questions. Get really curious about the other person. Turn some of your regular closed, factual questions into open questions that invite them to share their thoughts and feelings about a topic (and that can’t be answered with a yes or no). Show that you’re listening by following up with a “tell me more” about one thing they said. Create a sense of in-group. Look for points of similarity or connection—shared goals, gripes, or interests—to create a sense of in-group that means the other person’s brain sees you as friend rather than foe. Use reciprocal disclosure. If you’d like the other person to open up to you, think about what you’re willing to show and share of yourself. Pocket that phone.

"There are days when it feels as if other people’s demands are pressing in on us from all sides. Kristen certainly felt like that during much of her early career. She’s a sharp-minded HR director for a global pharmaceutical company, with four children, a long commute, and a busy job. She initially struggled to find her balance as her family grew. “When I came back to work after my third maternity leave,” she recalls (slipping into the present tense), “I’m feeling like I haven’t slept in four years. I’m three months behind because no one did my work while I was gone, and I’m way overloaded. I’m sitting in my office, feeling so mad, and I wanted to articulate who I was mad at. Initially I directed it at my company. I was mad because they were making me come to meetings really early, and they were making me stay really late. But then I thought, who is ‘the company’?” And in that moment, she says, “I had this epiphany, because I realized I was mostly mad at me and my lack of boundaries. I’d let things get out of control and I was trying to find someone else to blame. But if I didn’t have boundaries, who else was going to give them to me?” She laughs and shakes her head. “Did I think the company was going to say, ‘Oh, Kristen, you’re a new mom, poor you, don’t work before eight, don’t stay later than six’? No, it was up to me. Perhaps it shouldn’t have been, but it kind of always is.” So she decided to take control. “I wrote on my notepad what my boundaries were: ‘I don’t accept meetings before eight. I don’t stay past six. Between noon and one I’m going to be at my desk and I’m going to eat lunch. When I’m home, I’m home; when I’m at work, I’m at work.’ ” It was a very short list. “If it had a negative impact on my career, so be it, I thought. I couldn’t carry on the way I’d been going. The irony is that after I instituted that list of boundaries, my career skyrocketed.” Why did she think that happened? “Because it made me calmer and more effective. Also, I wasn’t an executive at the time, but I think it showed that I had the capacity to be one, that I knew how to manage myself.”",How to Have a Good Day: Harness the Power of Behavioral Science to Transform Your Working Life,Caroline Webb,B00X2F7RPG,,yellow,,location,1974,2018-10-15 04:56:00+00:00

And I’ve found that asking this simple question reminds me that I have some choices in how I decide to react. It starts to reengage rational thought, without fail.

"Some years ago, I discussed the importance of reciprocity with a group of partners from a private equity firm. Their business involved buying underperforming companies and turning them around, so they could resell the companies for more money some years down the line. They appointed experienced executives to run the companies they owned, and they wanted these executives to keep them in the loop about all the issues they were wrestling with. And for that, they knew they needed to build trust. But it was proving mighty hard. It turned out that their handpicked executives didn’t much feel like pouring their hearts out to the owners, and the owners weren’t entirely sure why. After speaking to some of their executives, I realized what was going on. The executives didn’t really see the private equity guys as real people. In their eyes, they were simply corporate overlords, to be avoided if possible, and certainly not to be confided in. The private equity partners were shocked and disappointed. But when I asked them what they’d shared with the executives of their own thoughts and concerns about work or life, they looked bemused. They were certainly ready to spout advice or ideas. But talk about their own personal worries with these executives? “Why on earth would we do that?” they asked. Because, I said, they were expecting the executives to do exactly that.

Decide on the best time of day to tackle each batch of tasks, including one or two “email zones.” Create longer blocks of uninterrupted time for your most important work. Can you move some appointments to create clearer zones? Remove distractions. Minimize interruptions, to help you focus your attention on the task at hand. Which alerts can you switch off?

"For most of us, the highest form of helpfulness is to step in and offer suggestions. But when someone is telling us about a problem and we leap in to offer advice, a paradox arises: it’s all too easy to leave the other person feeling bombarded rather than soothed. “Have you done this? What about that?” we say. Inadvertently, we can even make the other person feel judged, as if they should have spotted the answer themselves. If that happens, their brain is likely to register our well-intentioned help as a kind of threat—which makes them less creative in their own thinking about the problem. By the end of the discussion, instead of saying, “Wow, I feel motivated and empowered now,” they’re mumbling, “Well, I guess I’ll go and do all those things, then.”",How to Have a Good Day: Harness the Power of Behavioral Science to Transform Your Working Life,Caroline Webb,B00X2F7RPG,,yellow,favorite,location,3039,2018-10-15 04:56:00+00:00

"So if you sense that someone is upset or irritated—whether with you or someone else—and you can find a way to talk to him or her directly, try this simple “notice-acknowledge-offer” routine: Step 1: Notice. Tell the person what you’ve noticed and then ask for their perspective. Focus on a factual observation and phrase it in neutral terms. For example: “I noticed that the board went with option X after all. What’s your view on that?” Or “I noticed that you frowned when I made that suggestion. Can I ask what was on your mind?” Step 2: Acknowledge. Once they’ve shared their feelings, show that you’ve understood by saying, “I’m sorry, that must be frustrating/concerning/annoying” (select an appropriate sympathetic word). This step signals that you’re not dismissing whatever is bothering them. It doesn’t matter if you think they shouldn’t feel frustrated, concerned, or annoyed. If they think they have cause, their brain will be on the defensive. Making them feel heard helps to reduce the state of alert in their brain. And the word “sorry” is helpful even if you’ve done nothing wrong—it conveys that you care (just as it does when you say “sorry for your loss” to someone who’s been bereaved). Step 3: Offer. Ask, “Is there anything I can do to improve the situation?” Often the answer is no, but if the answer is yes, it’s good to know. It’s important to ask even if you didn’t cause the problem; you may see a way to help, and if you want the person’s dysfunctional behavior to stop, it’s worth the effort.",How to Have a Good Day: Harness the Power of Behavioral Science to Transform Your Working Life,Caroline Webb,B00X2F7RPG,,yellow,,location,2789,2018-10-15 04:56:00+00:00

"Here’s how to do some extreme listening: It’s not about you. First, let go of your need to feel helpful by making comments and suggestions. You’re giving the other person something at least as precious: the encouragement and time to think clearly. You can provide more traditional forms of help later on, if needed. Let the other person set the topic. If it’s not already obvious what he or she is struggling with, ask, “What would you find helpful to talk through?” Don’t interrupt. Let them talk at length; aim for at least five minutes. It’s sometimes hard not to fill the gaps when the other person pauses to think. But don’t jump in. Listen intently. Make encouraging noises. Nod. Wait. Maintain eye contact. Even when the other person glances away, keep your eyes on them. Stay present and responsive. Keep them talking. When the other person runs out of steam, invite them to continue. Ask: “Is there anything else you’re thinking about this?” If the answer is no, that’s fine. When they’re done, ask, “So what do you think you’ll do now?” Don’t feel you need to offer anything clever beyond that. And once again, remember: it’s about the other person, not you. Your thoughts, ideas, and suggestions will be bubbling up inside you. If they threaten to boil over, remember that you’ll have a chance to share them some other time, and bring your focus back to the other person.",How to Have a Good Day: Harness the Power of Behavioral Science to Transform Your Working Life,Caroline Webb,B00X2F7RPG,,yellow,,location,3050,2018-10-15 04:56:00+00:00

"The kind of question that signals genuine curiosity is quite different. First, it’s an open question—one that can’t be answered with a yes or a no. Second, it invites people to share their thoughts, motivations, or feelings, rather than merely facts. Third, you actually intend to listen and reflect on the answer. I call them “quality questions” because they immediately shift the quality of a conversation. For example: Not “Have you thought of XYZ?” but “How are you thinking about this?” Not “Is the reason you’re struggling because this is all new to you?” but “What’s making it feel hard?” Not “Could you make things better by delegating more?” but “What would the ideal situation look like for you?” And if you want to ask about people’s personal lives, you could get beyond the normal “How was your weekend?” with a question like “What do you do outside work? How did you develop an interest in that?” All of which can be followed with a simple invitation to share more, before you jump in with your own comments. Merely by saying “Tell me more about that,” you’ll be in the top percentile of listeners that anyone will meet today.2",How to Have a Good Day: Harness the Power of Behavioral Science to Transform Your Working Life,Caroline Webb,B00X2F7RPG,,yellow,,location,2316,2018-10-15 04:56:00+00:00

"Look at your schedule for today and tomorrow, and plan for the following: Take smart breaks. How can you make sure you take regular breaks, at least every ninety minutes and between each “zone” of tasks in your day? Make decisions at peaks (not troughs). Which tasks will require you to make a lot of choices? How can you make them when your brain is freshest? Schedule breathing room. Can you schedule meetings or offer your time in blocks of twenty-five or forty-five minutes (instead of thirty or sixty minutes), to create micro-breaks between commitments? For commitments that are already scheduled, can you aim to wrap up a little early? Allow reflection time. At the end of each task or meeting, take thirty seconds to capture your biggest insights. Try an end-of-day reflection practice such as DATE (discovered, achieved, thankful for, experienced).",How to Have a Good Day: Harness the Power of Behavioral Science to Transform Your Working Life,Caroline Webb,B00X2F7RPG,,yellow,favorite,location,1765,2018-10-15 04:56:00+00:00
"One helpful sign that you may be falling victim to confirmation bias is when you catch yourself using what I call absolute language: words like “never,” “always,” “completely,” “totally,” “absolutely,” or “definitely,” perhaps with a dash of “terrible” or “awful.” ... So if you find yourself using strong words as you think or talk about the tasks ahead, or the people involved, take that as a helpful cue to check your perspective. Ask another “A” question: What negative assumptions do you have about this person or activity? And then take one more step back, and ask yourself: What are you likely to focus on to confirm your assumptions? If you had to challenge your negative assumptions, what would you say? What counterevidence can you look out for, to help you keep an open mind?",How to Have a Good Day: Harness the Power of Behavioral Science to Transform Your Working Life,Caroline Webb,B00X2F7RPG,,yellow,,location,924,2018-08-23 04:56:00+00:00

"To make our positive intentions an even stronger base for the day we want to have, there’s one more step we can take, which is to check and challenge any negative assumptions we’re carrying into the day. Like our priorities, concerns, and moods, our assumptions are another selective attention filter that our automatic brain uses to simplify our experience of the world. It works like this: If we encounter some information or behavior that matches what we’re expecting, our automatic system will probably make sure we’re aware of it. If, however, we encounter something that runs counter to our expectations, our automatic system will tend to disregard it. Known as confirmation bias, this is a cognitive shortcut that saves us considerable mental energy, since it stops us from having to develop a new mental model about the world every time we run into evidence that contradicts our beliefs.",How to Have a Good Day: Harness the Power of Behavioral Science to Transform Your Working Life,Caroline Webb,B00X2F7RPG,,yellow,,location,899,2018-10-15 04:56:00+00:00

"First, it has limited capacity, because it relies heavily on something called working memory. Part notepad for incoming new data, part librarian for accessing stored experience, our working memory is the space where we hold information in our conscious mind as we figure out what to do with it.

"Second, filter your inbox Just as our brain wastes time switching from tasks to email and back to tasks again, it wastes some time by flipping between different types of emails requiring very different types of cognitive response. There are messages from important people who want a reply, mail you’re merely cc’ed on, subscriptions, meeting invitations, and junk of various types. They all make different types of demands on your brain. So you can save yet more neural processing time if you fully exploit your email program’s capacity to filter emails into different folders, allowing you to group together different types of email and deal with each in turn. Here are some filters and folders you might want to create: Email sent from individuals to you directly. If you can, separate out the emails where you’re merely cc’ed. You can create a special folder or tab for especially important people. Calendar invitations should also be separated, if you get a lot of them. Things to read.

For unavoidably longer emails, break them up into short paragraphs and make them easy to navigate, maybe using bullets and headings.

Ask them to give you one or two specific examples of times you seemed particularly enthused or impressive, and ask them what they think that means your signature strengths are.

"For many people, I gather that the social order is a reified emotional thing separate from respect, separate from the goods that status can obtain, separate from any deliberative reasoning about who ought to have those goods, and separate from any belief about who consented to be part of an implicit community agreement. There’s just a felt sense that some people are lower in various status hierarchies, while others are higher; and overreaching by trying to claim significantly more status than you currently have is an offense against the reified social order, which has an immediate emotional impact, separate from any beliefs about the further consequences that a social order causes. One may also have explicit beliefs about possible benefits or harms that could be caused by disruptions to the status hierarchy, but the status regulation feeling is more basic than that and doesn’t depend on high-level theories or cost-benefit calculations.",Inadequate Equilibria: Where and How Civilizations Get Stuck,Eliezer Yudkowsky,B076Z64CPG,,yellow,,location,2250,2018-11-15 04:56:00+00:00

"there’s a strict order to debate. If you’re going to argue against an idea, it’s bad form to start off by arguing that the idea was generated by a flawed thought process, before you’ve explained why you think the idea itself is wrong. Even if we’re refuting geocentrism, we should first say how we know that the Sun does not orbit the Earth, and only then pontificate about what cognitive biases might have afflicted geocentrists. As a rule, an idea should initially be discussed as though it had descended from the heavens on a USB stick spontaneously generated by an evaporating black hole, before any word is said psychoanalyzing the people who believe it.

"When an economist says that a market price is efficient over a two-year time horizon, they mean: “The current price that balances the supply and demand of this financial instrument well reflects all public information affecting a boundedly rational estimate of the future supply-demand balancing point of this financial instrument in two years.” They’re relating the present intersection of these two curves to an idealized cognitive estimate of the curves’ future intersection. But this is a long sentence in the language of a hunter-gatherer. If somebody doesn’t have all the terms of that sentence precompiled in their head, then they’re likely to interpret the sentence in the idiom of ordinary human life and ordinary human relationships. People have an innate understanding of “true” in the sense of a map that reflects the territory, and they can imagine processes that produce good maps; but probability and microeconomics are less intuitive.3 What people hear when you talk about “efficient prices” is that a cold-blooded machine has determined that some people ought to be paid $9/hour. And they hear the economist saying nice things about the machine, praising it as “efficient,” implying that the machine is right about this $9/hour price being good for society, that this price well reflects what someone’s efforts are justly worth. They hear you agreeing with this pitiless machine’s judgment about how the intuitive web of obligations and incentives and reputation ought properly to cash out for a human interaction.",Inadequate Equilibria: Where and How Civilizations Get Stuck,Eliezer Yudkowsky,B076Z64CPG,,yellow,,location,290,2018-11-15 04:56:00+00:00

"If that’s all true, it’s not a coincidence that neither I nor any of the other onlookers could make money on our advance prediction. The startup equity market was inefficient (a price underwent a predictable decline), but it wasn’t exploitable.4 There was no way to make a profit just by predicting that Sequoia had overpaid for the stock it bought.

Step two is to adjust your mind’s exploitability detectors until they’re not always answering, “You couldn’t possibly exploit this domain, foolish mortal,” or, “Why trust those hedge-fund managers to price stocks correctly when they have such poor incentives?” And then you can move on to step three: the fine-tuning against reality.",Inadequate Equilibria: Where and How Civilizations Get Stuck,Eliezer Yudkowsky,B076Z64CPG,,yellow,,location,1497,2018-11-15 04:56:00+00:00

"CECIE: In our world, there are a lot of people screaming, “Pay attention to this thing I’m indignant about over here!” In fact, there are enough people screaming that there’s an inexploitable market in indignation. The dead-babies problem can’t compete in that market; there’s no free energy left for it to eat, and it doesn’t have an optimal indignation profile. There’s no single individual villain. The business about competing omega-3 and omega-6 metabolic pathways is something that only a fraction of people would understand on a visceral level; and even if those people posted it to their Facebook walls, most of their readers wouldn’t understand and repost, so the dead-babies problem has relatively little virality. Being indignant about this particular thing doesn’t signal your moral superiority to anyone else in particular, so it’s not viscerally enjoyable to engage in the indignation. As for adding a further scream, “But wait, this matter really is important!”, that’s the part subject to the lemons problem.

"One systemic problem can often be overcome by one altruist in the right place. Two systemic problems are another matter entirely. Usually when we find trillion-dollar bills lying on the ground in real life, it’s a symptom of (1) a central-command bottleneck that nobody else is allowed to fix, as with the European Central Bank wrecking Europe, or (2) a system with enough moving parts that at least two parts are simultaneously broken, meaning that single actors cannot defy the system. To modify an old aphorism: usually, when things suck, it’s because they suck in a way that’s a Nash equilibrium. In the same way that inefficient markets tend systematically to be inexploitable, grossly inadequate systems tend systematically to be unfixable by individual non-billionaires. But then you can sometimes still insert a wedge for yourself, even if you can’t save the whole system. Something that’s systemically hard to fix for the whole planet is sometimes possible to fix in your own two-bedroom apartment. So inadequacy is even more important than exploitability on a day-to-day basis, because it’s inadequacy-generating situations that lead to low-hanging fruits large enough to be worthwhile at the individual level.",Inadequate Equilibria: Where and How Civilizations Get Stuck,Eliezer Yudkowsky,B076Z64CPG,,yellow,,location,435,2018-11-15 04:56:00+00:00
"So the distinction is: Efficiency: “Microsoft’s stock price is neither too low nor too high, relative to anything you can possibly know about Microsoft’s stock price.” Inexploitability: “Some houses and housing markets are overpriced, but you can’t make a profit by short-selling them, and you’re unlikely to find any substantially underpriced houses—the market as a whole isn’t rational, but it contains participants who have money and understand housing markets as well as you do.” Adequacy: “Okay, the medical sector is a wildly crazy place where different interventions have orders-of-magnitude differences in cost-effectiveness, but at least there’s no well-known but unused way to save ten thousand lives for just ten dollars each, right?

"And we tend to underestimate how different other people are from ourselves. Once upon a time, there used to be a great and acrimonious debate in philosophy about whether people had “mental imagery” (whether or not people actually see a little picture of an elephant when they think about an elephant). It later turned out that some people see a little picture of an elephant, some people don’t, and both sides thought that the way they personally worked was so fundamental to cognition that they couldn’t imagine that other people worked differently.

"We can see the notion of an inexploitable market as generalizing the notion of an efficient market as follows: in both cases, there’s no free energy inside the system. In both markets, there’s a horde of hungry organisms moving around trying to eat up all the free energy. In the efficient market, every predictable price change corresponds to free energy (easy money) and so the equilibrium where hungry organisms have eaten all the free energy corresponds to an equilibrium of no predictable price changes. In a merely inexploitable market, there are predictable price changes that don’t correspond to free energy, like an overpriced house that will decline later, and so the no-free-energy equilibrium can still involve predictable price changes.7",Inadequate Equilibria: Where and How Civilizations Get Stuck,Eliezer Yudkowsky,B076Z64CPG,,yellow,,location,346,2018-11-15 04:56:00+00:00

"Fortunately for governments, mere humans (unfortunately for them) are so constructed that as long as they live, there is always something to take away from them. Even a man imprisoned for life, deprived of movement, of the sight of the sky, deprived of a family and property, can be transferred to a damp punishment cell, denied hot food, and beaten with canes; and these minor punishments are just as keenly felt as his earlier dislodgment from the peak of freedom and prosperity. It is to avoid these vexatious later punishments that a prisoner duly complies with abhorrent and degrading prison regulations that gradually destroy his humanity.",In the First Circle: The First Uncensored Edition,Aleksandr I.

He had never imagined that it would all be so crude, so stupid—and so ineluctable. The people waiting for him in the Lubyanka, low-ranking, obtuse people were uninterested in him as an individual and in the act that had brought him there but had a zealous concern for trivialities that took him by surprise and left him helpless. And anyway, what form could resistance take, and where would it get him?

"Stalin had thought it over recently and reached clear conclusions. Naive and shortsighted people pictured Communism as a kingdom of plenty, of freedom from necessity. But that would be an impossible social order; at that rate Communism would be worse than bourgeois anarchy! The first and main characteristic of true Communism must be discipline, total subordination to authority, and strict execution of orders. (The intelligentsia must be kept under particularly firm control.) Second, “plenty” must be modest plenty, not even sufficiency in fact, because overprosperous people fell into ideological disarray, as could be seen in the West. If a man does not have to worry about food, he escapes the material pressure of history, being ceases to determine consciousness, and everything is topsy-turvy.

"It is rightly said that we reach maturity at forty. Only then do we finally understand how to live and how to behave. Only then did Stalin become aware of his greatest strength: the power of the unspoken verdict. Your mind is made up, but the person whose head depends on your decision must not learn it too soon. Time enough for that when his head rolls! Another strength was his habit of disbelieving what others said and attaching no importance to his own words. Say not what you mean to do (you may not know it until the moment comes) but what puts the other person at ease. A third rule for the strong man is never to forgive anyone who betrays you, and if your teeth are in someone’s throat, never to let go, though the sun rises in the west and portents appear in the heavens. A fourth rule for the strong man is not to rely on theory. Theory never helped anyone; you can always produce some sort of theoretical justification after the event.

Volodin’s arrest, interrogation, and imprisonment mirror the author’s experiences so closely as almost to merge fact and fiction. As Nerzhin and Volodin confront the apparatus of the totalitarian state, they move through parallel stages of intellectual and moral development. Both characters are marked by an early phase of unthinking conformity with Soviet ideology. Both reinforce a love of country through their profound appreciation of its natural beauty. Both find their minds opened by suffering. Both move through a philosophical phase of skepticism, which in Volodin’s case centers on Epicurus’s thought and in Nerzhin’s case is akin to Socratic questioning rather than to a cynicism rooted in relativism.

"“All these sharashkas date from 1930, when they started rounding up engineers in droves. The first was on Furkasov. That’s where they planned the White Sea Canal. Then there was the Ramzin outfit. The experiment caught on. Outside, you can never get two great engineers or two great scientists to work together on the same project. They’re rivals for fame, for a Stalin Prize, and sooner or later one of them will squeeze out the other. That’s why outside every project planning team is a pale penumbra around one brilliant head. But what happens in a sharashka? Nobody needs to worry about fame or money. If Nikolai Nikolaich gets half a glass of sour cream, Pyotr Petrovich gets the other half. A dozen bears can live amicably in the same den because there’s nowhere else for them to go. They play a little chess, smoke a few cigarettes, and when they get bored, somebody says, ‘I know, let’s invent something!’ ‘Good idea!’ Many of our scientific advances were made that way.

Whereupon Lenin took several blank sheets of paper, signed at the bottom of each page with the words “approved in advance,” and in their presence handed these to Trotsky to fill in when he pleased. He learned his lesson! He was ashamed! What had he been complaining about?

"Where does it come from, that commanding manner, that way of endowing every little movement with significance? The finger movements, the gestures, the raised eyebrows, the intent gaze, were no doubt those of the young Koba. But in him none of this had frightened people; no one had read into these movements a terrible meaning. Only when holes enough had been made in the backs of heads did people begin to see in the Leader’s slightest movement a hint, a warning, a threat, an order. Noticing other people’s reactions, Stalin started observing himself, discerned the latent menace in his gestures and glances, and began consciously cultivating them so that they became still more predictable in their effect on those around him.",In the First Circle: The First Uncensored Edition,Aleksandr I.

"Thus when secessionists protested that they were acting to preserve traditional rights and values, they were correct. They fought to protect their constitutional liberties against the perceived northern threat to overthrow them. The South’s concept of republicanism had not changed in three-quarters of a century; the North’s had. __With complete sincerity the South fought to preserve its version of the republic of the founding fathers—a government of limited powers that protected the rights of property and whose constituency comprised an independent gentry and yeomanry of the white race undisturbed by large cities, heartless factories, restless free workers, and class conflict. The accession to power of the Republican party, with its ideology of competitive, egalitarian, free-labor capitalism, was a signal to the South that the northern majority had turned irrevocably toward this frightening, revolutionary future.__",The Illustrated Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era (Oxford History of the United States Book 6),James M.

"Lincoln’s visit to Richmond produced the most unforgettable scenes of this unforgettable war. With an escort of only ten sailors, the president walked the streets while Porter peered nervously at every window for would-be assassins. But the Emancipator was soon surrounded by an impenetrable cordon of black people shouting “Glory to God! Glory! Glory! Glory!” “Bless the Lord! The great Messiah! I knowed him as soon as I seed him. He’s been in my heart four long years. Come to free his children from bondage. Glory, Hallelujah!” Several freed slaves touched Lincoln to make sure he was real. “I know I am free,” shouted an old woman, “for I have seen Father Abraham and felt him.” Overwhelmed by rare emotions, Lincoln said to one black man who fell on his knees in front of him: “Don’t kneel to me. That is not right. You must kneel to God only, and thank Him for the liberty you will enjoy hereafter.”33 Among the reporters from northern newspapers who described these events was one whose presence was a potent symbol of the revolution. He was T. Morris Chester, who sat at a desk in the Confederate Capitol drafting his dispatch to the Philadelphia Press. “Richmond has never before presented such a spectacle of jubilee,” he wrote. “What a wonderful change has come over the spirit of Southern dreams.”34 Chester was a black man.",The Illustrated Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era (Oxford History of the United States Book 6),James M.

"Most attempts to explain southern defeat or northern victory lack the dimension of contingency—the recognition that at numerous critical points during the war things might have gone altogether differently. Four major turning points defined the eventual outcome. The first came in the summer of 1862, when the counter-offensives of Jackson and Lee in Virginia and Bragg and Kirby Smith in the West arrested the momentum of a seemingly imminent Union victory. This assured a prolongation and intensification of the conflict and created the potential for Confederate success, which appeared imminent before each of the next three turning points.",The Illustrated Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era (Oxford History of the United States Book 6),James M.

"The Emancipation Proclamation became the Miscegenation Proclamation. A pamphlet entitled Miscegenation Indorsed by the Republican Party circulated far and wide. Numerous cartoons showed thick-lipped, grinning, coarse black men kissing apple-cheeked girls “with snow-white bosoms” or dancing with them at the “Miscegenation Ball” to follow Lincoln’s re-election. The “Benediction” of a leaflet entitled “Black Republican Prayer” invoked “the blessings of Emancipation throughout our unhappy land” so that “illustrious, sweet-scented Sambo [may] nestle in the bosom of every Abolition woman, that she may be quickened by the pure blood of the majestic African.”27 Campaign pamphlets and newspapers reported that “a great many squint-eyed yellow babies” had been born in New Orleans since Benjamin Butler was there; that New England schoolmarms teaching freedpeople on the South Carolina sea islands had produced numerous mulatto children; and that five thousand mulatto babies had been born in Washington since 1861.

"The first of these occurred in the fall of 1862, when battles at Antietam and Perryville threw back Confederate invasions, forestalled European mediation and recognition of the Confederacy, perhaps prevented a Democratic victory in the northern elections of 1862 that might have inhibited the government’s ability to carry on the war, and set the stage for the Emancipation Proclamation which enlarged the scope and purpose of the conflict.

"The old federal republic in which the national government had rarely touched the average citizen except through the post-office gave way to a more centralized polity that taxed the people directly and created an internal revenue bureau to collect these taxes, drafted men into the army, expanded the jurisdiction of federal courts, created a national currency and a national banking system, and established the first national agency for social welfare—the Freedmen’s Bureau. Eleven of the first twelve amendments to the Constitution had limited the powers of the national government; six of the next seven, beginning with the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865, vastly expanded those powers at the expense of the states.",The Illustrated Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era (Oxford History of the United States Book 6),James M.

"Robert E. Lee’s opinion would have a decisive influence. For months rumors had circulated that he favored arming the slaves. Lee had indeed expressed his private opinion that “we should employ them without delay [even] at the risk which may be produced upon our social institutions.” On February 18 he broke his public silence with a letter to the congressional sponsor of a Negro soldier bill. This measure was “not only expedient but necessary,” wrote Lee. “The negroes, under proper circumstances, will make efficient soldiers. I think we could at least do as well with them as the enemy. . . . Those who are employed should be freed.

"As usual, Abraham Lincoln said it best. In April 1864 he returned to Baltimore for the first time since he had passed through the city secretly in the middle of the night three years earlier to foil a plot to assassinate him. This time he came in the full light of day and gave one of his few public speeches during the war. “The world has never had a good definition of the word liberty, and the American people, just now, are much in want of one,” said Lincoln on that occasion. “We all declare for liberty; but in using the same word we not all mean the same thing. With some the word liberty may mean for each man to do as he pleases with himself, and the product of his labor; while with others the same may mean for some men to do as they please with other men, and the product of other men’s labor. Here are two, not only different, but incompatible things, called by the same name —liberty.” Lincoln went on to illustrate his point with a parable about animals. “The shepherd drives the wolf from the sheep’s throat,” he said, “for which the sheep thanks the shepherd as a liberator, while the wolf denounces him for the same act as the destroyer of liberty, especially as the sheep is a black one. Plainly the sheep and the wolf are not agreed upon a definition of the word liberty; and precisely the same difference prevails to-day among us human creatures, even in the North, and all professing to love liberty. Hence we behold the processes by which thousands are daily passing from under the yoke of bondage, hailed by some as the advance of liberty, and bewailed by others as the destruction of all liberty.”",The Illustrated Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era (Oxford History of the United States Book 6),James M.

"Free labor under capitalism was a war of each against all, wrote Fitzhugh, a sort of social cannibalism. “Slavery is the natural and normal condition of society,” he maintained. “The situation of the North is abnormal and anomalous.” To bestow “upon men equality of rights, is but giving license to the strong to oppress the weak” because “capital exercises a more perfect compulsion over free laborers than human masters over slaves; for free laborers must at all times work or starve, and slaves are supported whether they work or not.” Therefore “we slaveholders say you must recur to domestic slavery, the oldest, the best, the most common form of Socialism”",The Illustrated Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era (Oxford History of the United States Book 6),James M.

"At least one listener interpreted this speech as moving Lincoln closer to the radical Republicans. “That means nigger citizenship,” snarled John Wilkes Booth to a companion. “Now, by God, I’ll put him through.

"Of all the explanations for Confederate defeat, the loss of will thesis suffers most from its own particular fallacy of reversibility—that of putting the cart before the horse. Defeat causes demoralization and loss of will; victory pumps up morale and the will to win. Nothing illustrates this better than the radical transformation of northern will from defeatism in August 1864 to a “depth of determination . . . to fight to the last” that “astonished” a British journalist a month later. The southern loss of will was a mirror image of this northern determination. These changes of mood were caused mainly by events on the battlefield. Northern victory and southern defeat in the war cannot be understood apart from the contingency that hung over every campaign, every battle, every election, every decision during the war. This phenomenon of contingency can best be presented in a narrative format—a format this book has tried to provide.",The Illustrated Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era (Oxford History of the United States Book 6),James M.

"Having gained votes in 1862 by tarring Republicans with the brush of racial equality, Democrats expected to do the same in 1864. The vulgarity of their tactics almost surpasses belief. An editor and a reporter for the New York World, McClellan’s most powerful newspaper, coined a new word with their anonymous pamphlet Miscegenation: The Theory of the Blending of the Races. Pretending to be Republicans, the authors recommended “miscegenation” as a solution of the race problem. This fusion, the pamphlet declared, would particularly “be of infinite service to the Irish.” If the Republicans were re-elected they would prosecute the war to “its final fruit, to the blending of the white and the black.” Although the Democratic press tried to pump up this hoax into a serious Republican program, few readers except confirmed copperheads seemed to take it seriously.",The Illustrated Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era (Oxford History of the United States Book 6),James M.

"But while Fitzhugh’s notions were eccentric they were not unique. Some proslavery proponents drew a distinction between southern yeomen and northern workers or farmers.

"“the country will not venture to deny to General Lee . . . anything he may ask for.”16 By a vote of 40 to 37 the House passed a bill authorizing the president to requisition a quota of black soldiers from each state. In deference to state’s rights, the bill did not mandate freedom for slave soldiers. The Senate nevertheless defeated the measure by a single vote, with both senators from Lee’s own state voting No. The Virginia legislature meanwhile enacted its own law for the enlistment of black soldiers—without, however, requiring the emancipation of those who were slaves—and instructed its senators to vote for the congressional bill. They did so, enabling it to pass by 9 to 8 (with several abstentions) and become law on March 13. In the few weeks of life left to the Confederacy no other state followed Virginia’s lead. The two companies of black soldiers hastily organized in Richmond never saw action. Nor did most of these men obtain freedom until the Yankees—headed by a black cavalry regiment—marched into the Confederate capital on April 3.",The Illustrated Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era (Oxford History of the United States Book 6),James M.

"Lee sent a note through the lines offering to surrender. Grant’s headache and Meade’s illness vanished. The bleeding and dying were over; they had won. To the home of Wilmer McLean went Lee and Grant for the surrender formalities. In 1861, McLean had lived near Manassas, where his house was a Confederate headquarters and a Yankee shell had crashed into his dining room. He moved to this remote village in southside Virginia to escape the contending armies only to find the final drama of the war played out in his living room. The vanquished commander, six feet tall and erect in bearing, arrived in full-dress uniform with sash and jeweled sword; the victor, five feet eight with stooped shoulders, appeared in his usual private’s blouse with mud-spattered trousers tucked into muddy boots—because his headquarters wagon had fallen behind in the race to cut off the enemy.

"Sensational revelations of copperhead activities in Missouri helped the Republican effort to discredit the opposition as disloyal. Democrats fought back with their tried and true weapon—racism. On this issue the party remained united and consistent. Sixty-five of sixty-eight Democratic congressmen had voted against the 13th Amendment, denying it the necessary two-thirds majority in the House. These congressmen also published a manifesto denouncing the enlistment of black soldiers as a vile Republican scheme to establish “the equality of the black and white races.”",The Illustrated Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era (Oxford History of the United States Book 6),James M.

"Sixteen of the eighty Democrats finally voted for the Amendment; fourteen of them were lame ducks. Eight other Democrats had absented themselves. This enabled the Amendment to pass with two votes to spare, 119 to 56. When the result was announced, Republicans on the floor and spectators in the gallery broke into prolonged—and unprecedented—cheering, while in the streets of Washington cannons boomed a hundred-gun salute. The scene “beggared description,” wrote a Republican congressman in his diary. “Members joined in the shouting and kept it up for some minutes. Some embraced one another, others wept like children. I have felt, ever since the vote, as if I were in a new country.” By acclamation the House voted to adjourn for the rest of the day “in honor of this immortal and sublime event.”",The Illustrated Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era (Oxford History of the United States Book 6),James M.

One more reversal of that tide seemed possible in the summer of 1864 when appalling Union casualties and apparent lack of progress especially in Virginia brought the North to the brink of peace negotiations and the election of a Democratic president. But the capture of Atlanta and Sheridan’s destruction of Early’s army in the Shenandoah Valley clinched matters for the North. Only then did it become possible to speak of the inevitability of Union victory.

"Consider this, as well, in regard to oppression: any hierarchy creates winners and losers. The winners are, of course, more likely to justify the hierarchy and the losers to criticize it. But (1) the collective pursuit of any valued goal produces a hierarchy (as some will be better and some worse at that pursuit no matter what it is) and (2) it is the pursuit of goals that in large part lends life its sustaining meaning. We experience almost all the emotions that make life deep and engaging as a consequence of moving successfully towards something deeply desired and valued. The price we pay for that involvement is the inevitable creation of hierarchies of success, while the inevitable consequence is difference in outcome. Absolute equality would therefore require the sacrifice of value itself—and then there would be nothing worth living for.

"The third advantage to employing the Rogerian method is the difficulty it poses to the careless construction of straw-man arguments. When someone opposes you, it is very tempting to oversimplify, parody, or distort his or her position. This is a counterproductive game, designed both to harm the dissenter and to unjustly raise your personal status. By contrast, if you are called upon to summarize someone’s position, so that the speaking person agrees with that summary, you may have to state the argument even more clearly and succinctly than the speaker has even yet managed. If you first give the devil his due, looking at his arguments from his perspective, you can (1) find the value in them, and learn something in the process, or (2) hone your positions against them (if you still believe they are wrong) and strengthen your arguments further against challenge.

"Even more problematic is the insistence logically stemming from this presumption of social corruption that all individual problems, no matter how rare, must be solved by cultural restructuring, no matter how radical. Our society faces the increasing call to deconstruct its stabilizing traditions to include smaller and smaller numbers of people who do not or will not fit into the categories upon which even our perceptions are based. This is not a good thing. Each person’s private trouble cannot be solved by a social revolution, because revolutions are destabilizing and dangerous. We have learned to live together and organize our complex societies slowly and incrementally, over vast stretches of time, and we do not understand with sufficient exactitude why what we are doing works. Thus, altering our ways of social being carelessly in the name of some ideological shibboleth (diversity springs to mind) is likely to produce far more trouble than good, given the suffering that even small revolutions generally produce.",12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos,"Jordan B.

"Religion is instead about proper behaviour. It’s about what Plato called “the Good.” A genuine religious acolyte isn’t trying to formulate accurate ideas about the objective nature of the world (although he may be trying to do that too). He’s striving, instead, to be a “good person.” It may be the case that to him “good” means nothing but “obedient”—even blindly obedient. Hence the classic liberal Western enlightenment objection to religious belief: obedience is not enough. But it’s at least a start (and we have forgotten this): You cannot aim yourself at anything if you are completely undisciplined and untutored. You will not know what to target, and you won’t fly straight, even if you somehow get your aim right.

Many of these constraints are built in to us, as a consequence of billions of years of evolutionary processes. Others emerge as we are socialized into cooperating and competing peacefully and productively with others. Still more interpretations emerge as we discard counterproductive strategies through learning.

Your experience will improve, as you stop distorting it with inauthentic actions. You will then begin to discover new, more subtle things that you are doing wrong. Stop doing those, too.

"There are other serious problems lurking in the radical disciplines, apart from the falseness of their theories and methods, and their insistence that collective political activism is morally obligatory. There isn’t a shred of hard evidence to support any of their central claims: that Western society is pathologically patriarchal; that the prime lesson of history is that men, rather than nature, were the primary source of the oppression of women (rather than, as in most cases, their partners and supporters); that all hierarchies are based on power and aimed at exclusion.

"Why do we teach our young people that our incredible culture is the result of male oppression? Blinded by this central assumption disciplines as diverse as education, social work, art history, gender studies, literature, sociology and, increasingly, law actively treat men as oppressors and men’s activity as inherently destructive. They also often directly promote radical political action—radical by all the norms of the societies within which they are situated—which they do not distinguish from education. The Pauline Jewett Institute of Women’s and Gender Studies at Ottawa’s Carleton University, for example, encourages activism as part of their mandate. The Gender Studies Department at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, “teaches feminist, anti-racist, and queer theories and methods that centre activism for social change”—indicating support for the supposition that university education should above all foster political engagement of a particular kind.",12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos,"Jordan B.

"Many of the female clients (perhaps even a majority) that I see in my clinical practice have trouble in their jobs and family lives not because they are too aggressive, but because they are not aggressive enough. Cognitive-behavioural therapists call the treatment of such people, generally characterized by the more feminine traits of agreeableness (politeness and compassion) and neuroticism (anxiety and emotional pain), “assertiveness training.”197 Insufficiently aggressive women—and men, although more rarely—do too much for others. They tend to treat those around them as if they were distressed children. They tend to be naïve. They assume that cooperation should be the basis of all social transactions, and they avoid conflict (which means they avoid confronting problems in their relationships as well as at work). They continually sacrifice for others. This may sound virtuous—and it is definitely an attitude that has certain social advantages—but it can and often does become counterproductively one-sided. Because too-agreeable people bend over backwards for other people, they do not stand up properly for themselves. Assuming that others think as they do, they expect—instead of ensuring—reciprocity for their thoughtful actions. When this does not happen, they don’t speak up. They do not or cannot straightforwardly demand recognition.

But a secret unrest gnaws at her heart. She is still suffering, because life is suffering. She is lonesome and isolated and unfulfilled. But her obedience and self-obliteration eliminate all the meaning from her life. She has become nothing but a slave, a tool for others to exploit.

"And what about the idea that hitting a child merely teaches them to hit? First: No. Wrong. Too simple. For starters, “hitting” is a very unsophisticated word to describe the disciplinary act of an effective parent. If “hitting” accurately described the entire range of physical force, then there would be no difference between rain droplets and atom bombs. Magnitude matters—and so does context, if we’re not being wilfully blind and naïve about the issue. Every child knows the difference between being bitten by a mean, unprovoked dog and being nipped by his own pet when he tries playfully but too carelessly to take its bone. How hard someone is hit, and why they are hit, cannot merely be ignored when speaking of hitting. Timing, part of context, is also of crucial importance. If you flick your two-year-old with your finger just after he smacks the baby on the head with a wooden block, he will get the connection, and be at least somewhat less willing to smack her again in the future. That seems like a good outcome. He certainly won’t conclude that he should hit her more, using the flick of his mother’s finger as an example. He’s not stupid. He’s just jealous, impulsive and not very sophisticated. And how else are you going to protect his younger sibling? If you discipline ineffectively, then the baby will suffer. Maybe for years. The bullying will continue, because you won’t do a damn thing to stop it. You’ll avoid the conflict that’s necessary to establish peace. You’ll turn a blind eye. And then later, when the younger child confronts you (maybe even in adulthood), you’ll say, “I never knew it was like that.” You just didn’t want to know. So, you didn’t. You just rejected the responsibility of discipline, and justified it with a continual show of your niceness.

"In societies that are well-functioning—not in comparison to a hypothetical utopia, but contrasted with other existing or historical cultures—competence, not power, is a prime determiner of status. Competence. Ability. Skill. Not power. This is obvious both anecdotally and factually. No one with brain cancer is equity-minded enough to refuse the service of the surgeon with the best education, the best reputation and, perhaps, the highest earnings. Furthermore, the most valid personality trait predictors of long-term success in Western countries are intelligence (as measured with cognitive ability or IQ tests) and conscientiousness (a trait characterized by industriousness and orderliness).188 There are exceptions. Entrepreneurs and artists are higher in openness to experience,189 another cardinal personality trait, than in conscientiousness. But openness is associated with verbal intelligence and creativity, so that exception is appropriate and understandable. The predictive power of these traits, mathematically and economically speaking, is exceptionally high—among the highest, in terms of power, of anything ever actually measured at the harder ends of the social sciences. A good battery of personality/cognitive tests can increase the probability of employing someone more competent than average from 50:50 to 85:15. These are the facts, as well supported as anything in the social sciences (and this is saying more than you might think, as the social sciences are more effective disciplines than their cynical critics appreciate). Thus, not only is the state supporting one-sided radicalism, it is also supporting indoctrination. We do not teach our children that the world is flat.

"Someone living a life-lie is attempting to manipulate reality with perception, thought and action, so that only some narrowly desired and pre-defined outcome is allowed to exist. A life lived in this manner is based, consciously or unconsciously, on two premises. The first is that current knowledge is sufficient to define what is good, unquestioningly, far into the future. The second is that reality would be unbearable if left to its own devices. The first presumption is philosophically unjustifiable. What you are currently aiming at might not be worth attaining, just as what you are currently doing might be an error. The second is even worse. It is valid only if reality is intrinsically intolerable and, simultaneously, something that can be successfully manipulated and distorted. Such speaking and thinking requires the arrogance and certainty that the English poet John Milton’s genius identified with Satan, God’s highest angel gone most spectacularly wrong. The faculty of rationality inclines dangerously to pride: all I know is all that needs to be known.

He tried, gamely, to force out the offending food with his tongue. But I know how to deal with that, too. I just placed my forefinger horizontally across his lips. Some came out.

"It is to women’s clear advantage that men do not happily put up with dependency among themselves. Part of the reason that so many a working-class woman does not marry, now, as we have alluded to, is because she does not want to look after a man, struggling for employment, as well as her children. And fair enough. A woman should look after her children—although that is not all she should do. And a man should look after a woman and children—although that is not all he should do. But a woman should not look after a man, because she must look after children, and a man should not be a child. This means that he must not be dependent. This is one of the reasons that men have little patience for dependent men.

"The dogma of the Church was undermined by the spirit of truth strongly developed by the Church itself. That undermining culminated in the death of God. But the dogmatic structure of the Church was a necessary disciplinary structure. A long period of unfreedom—adherence to a singular interpretive structure—is necessary for the development of a free mind. Christian dogma provided that unfreedom. But the dogma is dead, at least to the modern Western mind. It perished along with God. What has emerged from behind its corpse, however—and this is an issue of central importance—is something even more dead; something that was never alive, even in the past: nihilism, as well as an equally dangerous susceptibility to new, totalizing, utopian ideas. It was in the aftermath of God’s death that the great collective horrors of Communism and Fascism sprang forth (as both Dostoevsky and Nietzsche predicted they would). Nietzsche, for his part, posited that individual human beings would have to invent their own values in the aftermath of God’s death. But this is the element of his thinking that appears weakest, psychologically: we cannot invent our own values, because we cannot merely impose what we believe on our souls. This was Carl Jung’s great discovery—made in no little part because of his intense study of the problems posed by Nietzsche.",12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos,"Jordan B.

"If you add some sugar to cold water, and stir it, the sugar will dissolve. If you heat up that water, you can dissolve more. If you heat the water to boiling, you can add a lot more sugar and get that to dissolve too. Then, if you take that boiling sugar water, and slowly cool it, and don’t bump it or jar it, you can trick it (I don’t know how else to phrase this) into holding a lot more dissolved sugar than it would have it if it had remained cold all along. That’s called a super-saturated solution. If you drop a single crystal of sugar into that super-saturated solution, all the excess sugar will suddenly and dramatically crystallize. It’s as if it were crying out for order. That was my client. People like her are the reason that the many forms of psychotherapy currently practised all work. People can be so confused that their psyches will be ordered and their lives improved by the adoption of any reasonably orderly system of interpretation. This is the bringing together of the disparate elements of their lives in a disciplined manner—any disciplined manner. So, if you have come apart at the seams (or if you never have been together at all) you can restructure your life on Freudian, Jungian, Adlerian, Rogerian or behavioural principles.

"Order and chaos are not understood first, objectively (as things or objects), and then personified. That would only be the case if we perceived objective reality first, and then inferred intent and purpose. But that isn’t how perception operates, despite our preconceptions. Perception of things as tools, for example, occurs before or in concert with perception of things as objects. We see what things mean just as fast or faster than we see what they are.33 Perception of things as entities with personality also occurs before perception of things as things. This is particularly true of the action of others,34 living others, but we also see the non-living “objective world” as animated, with purpose and intent. This is because of the operation of what psychologists have called “the hyperactive agency detector” within us.35 We evolved, over millennia, within intensely social circumstances.

"It’s also not the case (back to the question) that adult dictates are all arbitrary. That’s only true in a dysfunctional totalitarian state. But in civilized, open societies, the majority abide by a functional social contract, aimed at mutual betterment—or at least at existence in close proximity without too much violence. Even a system of rules that allows for only that minimum contract is by no means arbitrary, given the alternatives. If a society does not adequately reward productive, pro-social behavior, insists upon distributing resources in a markedly arbitrary and unfair manner, and allows for theft and exploitation, it will not remain conflict-free for long. If its hierarchies are based only (or even primarily) on power, instead of the competence necessary to get important and difficult things done, it will be prone to collapse, as well. This is even true, in simpler form, of the hierarchies of chimpanzees, which is an indication of its fundamental, biological and non-arbitrary emergent truth.104",12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos,"Jordan B.

"Every child should also be taught to comply gracefully with the expectations of civil society. This does not mean crushed into mindless ideological conformity. It means instead that parents must reward those attitudes and actions that will bring their child success in the world outside the family, and use threat and punishment when necessary to eliminate behaviours that will lead to misery and failure. There’s a tight window of opportunity for this, as well, so getting it right quickly matters. If a child has not been taught to behave properly by the age of four, it will forever be difficult for him or her to make friends. The research literature is quite clear on this. This matters, because peers are the primary source of socialization after the age of four. Rejected children cease to develop, because they are alienated from their peers. They fall further and further behind, as the other children continue to progress. Thus, the friendless child too often becomes the lonely, antisocial or depressed teenager and adult. This is not good. Much more of our sanity than we commonly realize is a consequence of our fortunate immersion in a social community. We must be continually reminded to think and act properly.

In addition to the filth, misery, disease, starvation, cruelty and ignorance that characterized the lives of both sexes, back before the twentieth century (when even people in the Western world typically existed on less than a dollar a day in today’s money) women also had to put up with the serious practical inconvenience of menstruation, the high probability of unwanted pregnancy, the chance of death or serious damage during childbirth, and the burden of too many young children.

"One of the major contributions of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s masterwork, The Gulag Archipelago, was his analysis of the direct causal relationship between the pathology of the Soviet prison-work-camp dependent state (where millions suffered and died) and the almost universal proclivity of the Soviet citizen to falsify his own day-to-day personal experience, deny his own state-induced suffering, and thereby prop up the dictates of the rational, ideology-possessed communist system. It was this bad faith, this denial, that in Solzhenitsyn’s opinion aided and abetted that great paranoid mass-murderer, Joseph Stalin, in his crimes.

"Sometimes, when people have a low opinion of their own worth—or, perhaps, when they refuse responsibility for their lives—they choose a new acquaintance, of precisely the type who proved troublesome in the past. Such people don’t believe that they deserve any better—so they don’t go looking for it. Or, perhaps, they don’t want the trouble of better. Freud called this a “repetition compulsion.” He thought of it as an unconscious drive to repeat the horrors of the past—sometimes, perhaps, to formulate those horrors more precisely, sometimes to attempt more active mastery and sometimes, perhaps, because no alternatives beckon. People create their worlds with the tools they have directly at hand. Faulty tools produce faulty results. Repeated use of the same faulty tools produces the same faulty results. It is in this manner that those who fail to learn from the past doom themselves to repeat it. It’s partly fate. It’s partly inability. It’s partly…unwillingness to learn? Refusal to learn? Motivated refusal to learn?",12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos,"Jordan B.

"And this brings us to a third erroneous concept: that nature is something strictly segregated from the cultural constructs that have emerged within it. The order within the chaos and order of Being is all the more “natural” the longer it has lasted. This is because “nature” is “what selects,” and the longer a feature has existed the more time it has had to be selected—and to shape life. It does not matter whether that feature is physical and biological, or social and cultural. All that matters, from a Darwinian perspective, is permanence—and the dominance hierarchy, however social or cultural it might appear, has been around for some half a billion years. It’s permanent. It’s real. The dominance hierarchy is not capitalism. It’s not communism, either, for that matter. It’s not the military-industrial complex. It’s not the patriarchy—that disposable, malleable, arbitrary cultural artefact. It’s not even a human creation; not in the most profound sense. It is instead a near-eternal aspect of the environment, and much of what is blamed on these more ephemeral manifestations is a consequence of its unchanging existence. We (the sovereign we, the we that has been around since the beginning of life) have lived in a dominance hierarchy for a long, long time. We were struggling for position before we had skin, or hands, or lungs, or bones. There is little more natural than culture.

"Viktor Frankl, the psychiatrist and Nazi concentration camp survivor who wrote the classic Man’s Search for Meaning, drew a similar social-psychological conclusion: deceitful, inauthentic individual existence is the precursor to social totalitarianism. Sigmund Freud, for his part, analogously believed that “repression” contributed in a non-trivial manner to the development of mental illness (and the difference between repression of truth and a lie is a matter of degree, not kind). Alfred Adler knew it was lies that bred sickness. C.G. Jung knew that moral problems plagued his patients, and that such problems were caused by untruth. All these thinkers, all centrally concerned with pathology both individual and cultural, came to the same conclusion: lies warp the structure of Being.

The ball on which Simons’s research subjects were focused was never obscured by the gorilla or by any of the six players. Because of that—because the gorilla did not interfere with the ongoing, narrowly defined task—it was indistinguishable from everything else the participants didn’t see, when they were looking at that ball. The big ape could be safely ignored. That’s how you deal with the overwhelming complexity of the world: you ignore it, while you concentrate minutely on your private concerns. You see things that facilitate your movement forward, toward your desired goals. You detect obstacles, when they pop up in your path. You’re blind to everything else (and there’s a lot of everything else—so you’re very blind). And it has to be that way, because there is much more of the world than there is of you.

"Skinner observed the animals he was training to perform such acts with exceptional care. Any actions that approximated what he was aiming at were immediately followed by a reward of just the right size: not small enough to be inconsequential, and not so large that it devalued future rewards. Such an approach can be used with children, and works very well. Imagine that you would like your toddler to help set the table. It’s a useful skill. You’d like him better if he could do it. It would be good for his (shudder) self-esteem. So, you break the target behaviour down into its component parts. One element of setting the table is carrying a plate from the cupboard to the table. Even that might be too complex. Perhaps your child has only been walking a few months. He’s still wobbly and unreliable. So, you start his training by handing him a plate and having him hand it back. A pat on the head could follow. You might turn it into a game. Pass with your left. Switch to your right. Circle around your back. Then you might give him a plate and take a few steps backward so that he has to traverse a few steps before giving it back. Train him to become a plate-handling virtuoso.

"So where does all that leave us? With the decision to discipline effectively, or to discipline ineffectively (but never the decision to forego discipline altogether, because nature and society will punish in a draconian manner whatever errors of childhood behavior remain uncorrected). So here are a few practical hints: time out can be an extremely effective form of punishment, particularly if the misbehaving child is welcome as soon as he controls his temper. An angry child should sit by himself until he calms down. Then he should be allowed to return to normal life. That means the child wins—instead of his anger. The rule is “Come be with us as soon as you can behave properly.” This is a very good deal for child, parent and society. You’ll be able to tell if your child has really regained control.

This means, in part, that people are blinded by their desires (as well as merely incapable of seeing things as they truly are). This is true, in a sense that transcends the metaphorical. Your eyes are tools. They are there to help you get what you want. The price you pay for that utility, that specific, focused direction, is blindness to everything else. This doesn’t matter so much when things are going well, and we are getting what we want (although it can be a problem, even then, because getting what we currently want can make blind us to higher callings). But all that ignored world presents a truly terrible problem when we’re in crisis, and nothing whatsoever is turning out the way we want it to. Then, there can be far too much to deal with.

But (and this is where you separate the metaphorical boys from the men, philosophically) the fact that power plays a role in human motivation does not mean that it plays the only role, or even the primary role.

Thus, instead of narcissistically inflating their own importance, they don’t value themselves at all, and they don’t take care of themselves with attention and skill. It seems that people often don’t really believe that they deserve the best care, personally speaking.

"But nature, the selecting agent, is not a static selector—not in any simple sense. Nature dresses differently for each occasion. Nature varies like a musical score—and that, in part, explains why music produces its deep intimations of meaning. As the environment supporting a species transforms and changes, the features that make a given individual successful in surviving and reproducing also transform and change. Thus, the theory of natural selection does not posit creatures matching themselves ever more precisely to a template specified by the world. It is more that creatures are in a dance with nature, albeit one that is deadly. “In my kingdom,” as the Red Queen tells Alice in Wonderland, “you have to run as fast as you can just to stay in the same place.” No one standing still can triumph, no matter how well constituted.",12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos,"Jordan B.

You might object, “But I’m an atheist.” No, you’re not (and if you want to understand this, you could read Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment, perhaps the greatest novel ever written, in which the main character, Raskolnikov, decides to take his atheism with true seriousness, commits what he has rationalized as a benevolent murder, and pays the price). You’re simply not an atheist in your actions, and it is your actions that most accurately reflect your deepest beliefs—those that are implicit, embedded in your being, underneath your conscious apprehensions and articulable attitudes and surface-level self-knowledge.

"The inflated self-importance, carelessness and sheer malevolence of the underground man dashes Liza’s last hopes. He understands this well. Worse: something in him was aiming at this all along. And he knows that too. But a villain who despairs of his villainy has not become a hero. A hero is something positive, not just the absence of evil. But Christ himself, you might object, befriended tax-collectors and prostitutes. How dare I cast aspersions on the motives of those who are trying to help? But Christ was the archetypal perfect man. And you’re you. How do you know that your attempts to pull someone up won’t instead bring them—or you—further down? Imagine the case of someone supervising an exceptional team of workers, all of them striving towards a collectively held goal; imagine them hardworking, brilliant, creative and unified. But the person supervising is also responsible for someone troubled, who is performing poorly, elsewhere. In a fit of inspiration, the well-meaning manager moves that problematic person into the midst of his stellar team, hoping to improve him by example. What happens?—and the psychological literature is clear on this point.64 Does the errant interloper immediately straighten up and fly right? No. Instead, the entire team degenerates. The newcomer remains cynical, arrogant and neurotic. He complains. He shirks. He misses important meetings. His low-quality work causes delays, and must be redone by others. He still gets paid, however, just like his teammates. The hard workers who surround him start to feel betrayed. “Why am I breaking myself into pieces striving to finish this project,” each thinks, “when my new team member never breaks a sweat?” The same thing happens when well-meaning counsellors place a delinquent teen among comparatively civilized peers.

"I learned two very important lessons from Carl Jung, the famous Swiss depth psychologist, about “doing unto others as you would have them do unto you” or “loving your neighbour as yourself.” The first lesson was that neither of these statements has anything to do with being nice. The second was that both are equations, rather than injunctions. If I am someone’s friend, family member, or lover, then I am morally obliged to bargain as hard on my own behalf as they are on theirs. If I fail to do so, I will end up a slave, and the other person a tyrant. What good is that? It is much better for any relationship when both partners are strong. Furthermore, there is little difference between standing up and speaking for yourself, when you are being bullied or otherwise tormented and enslaved, and standing up and speaking for someone else. As Jung points out, this means embracing and loving the sinner who is yourself, as much as forgiving and aiding someone else who is stumbling and imperfect.",12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos,"Jordan B.

"It is not unreasonable to note (if the deconstructionists would leave it at that) that science can be biased by the interests of power, and to warn against that—or to point out that evidence is too often what powerful people, including scientists, decide it is. After all, scientists are people too, and people like power, just like lobsters like power—just like deconstructionists like to be known for their ideas, and strive rightly to sit atop their academic hierarchies. But that doesn’t mean that science—or even deconstructionism—is only about power. Why believe such a thing? Why insist upon it? Perhaps it’s this: if only power exists, then the use of power becomes fully justifiable. There is no bounding such use by evidence, method, logic, or even the necessity for coherence. There is no bounding by anything “outside the text.” That leaves opinion—and force—and the use of force is all too attractive, under such circumstances, just as its employment in the service of that opinion is all too certain. The insane and incomprehensible postmodern insistence that all gender differences are socially constructed, for example, becomes all too understandable when its moral imperative is grasped—when its justification for force is once and for all understood: Society must be altered, or bias eliminated, until all outcomes are equitable. But the bedrock of the social constructionist position is the wish for the latter, not belief in the justice of the former. Since all outcome inequalities must be eliminated (inequality being the heart of all evil), then all gender differences must be regarded as socially constructed. Otherwise the drive for equality would be too radical, and the doctrine too blatantly propagandistic. Thus, the order of logic is reversed, so that the ideology can be camouflaged.

"Consistent correction of such action indicates the limits of acceptable aggression to the child. Its absence merely heightens curiosity—so the child will hit and bite and kick, if he is aggressive and dominant, until something indicates a limit. How hard can I hit Mommy? Until she objects. Given that, correction is better sooner than later (if the desired end result of the parent is not to be hit). Correction also helps the child learn that hitting others is a sub-optimal social strategy. Without that correction, no child is going to undergo the effortful process of organizing and regulating their impulses, so that those impulses can coexist, without conflict, within the psyche of the child, and in the broader social world.

"Carl Rogers, one of the twentieth century’s great psychotherapists, knew something about listening. He wrote, “The great majority of us cannot listen; we find ourselves compelled to evaluate, because listening is too dangerous. The first requirement is courage, and we do not always have it.”159 He knew that listening could transform people. On that, Rogers commented, “Some of you may be feeling that you listen well to people, and that you have never seen such results. The chances are very great indeed that your listening has not been of the type I have described.” He suggested that his readers conduct a short experiment when they next found themselves in a dispute: “Stop the discussion for a moment, and institute this rule: ‘Each person can speak up for himself only after he has first restated the ideas and feelings of the previous speaker accurately, and to that speaker’s satisfaction.’” I have found this technique very useful, in my private life and in my practice. I routinely summarize what people have said to me, and ask them if I have understood properly. Sometimes they accept my summary. Sometimes I am offered a small correction.

"I thought, “Part of you wants to be taken. Part of you wants to be a child. You were abused by your brothers and ignored by your father and so part of you wants revenge upon men. Part of you is guilty. Another part is ashamed. Another part is thrilled and excited. Who are you? What did you do? What happened?” What was the objective truth? There was no way of knowing the objective truth. And there never would be. There was no objective observer, and there never would be. There was no complete and accurate story. Such a thing did not and could not exist. There were, and are, only partial accounts and fragmentary viewpoints. But some are still better than others. Memory is not a description of the objective past. Memory is a tool. Memory is the past’s guide to the future.

It’s not “to remember the past.” It’s to stop the same damn thing from happening over and over. ... I thought, “I could simplify Miss S’s life.

I could tell her that she had indisputably been subject to violent and illicit acts, unless she had consented to each sexual move explicitly and verbally. I could tell her that she was an innocent victim.” I could have told her all that. And it would have been true. And she would have accepted it as true, and remembered it for the rest of her life. She would have been a new person, with a new history, and a new destiny. But I also thought, “I could tell Miss S that she is a walking disaster. I could tell her that she wanders into a bar like a courtesan in a coma, that she is a danger to herself and others, that she needs to wake up, and that if she goes to singles bars and drinks too much and is taken home and has rough violent sex (or even tender caring sex), then what the hell does she expect?” In other words, I could have told her, in more philosophical terms, that she was Nietzsche’s “pale criminal”—the person who at one moment dares to break the sacred law and at the next shrinks from paying the price.

"I teach excessively agreeable people to note the emergence of such resentment, which is a very important, although very toxic, emotion. There are only two major reasons for resentment: being taken advantage of (or allowing yourself to be taken advantage of), or whiny refusal to adopt responsibility and grow up. If you’re resentful, look for the reasons. Perhaps discuss the issue with someone you trust. Are you feeling hard done by, in an immature manner? If, after some honest consideration, you don’t think it’s that, perhaps someone is taking advantage of you. This means that you now face a moral obligation to speak up for yourself. This might mean confronting your boss, or your husband, or your wife, or your child, or your parents. It might mean gathering some evidence, strategically, so that when you confront that person, you can give them several examples of their misbehaviour (at least three), so they can’t easily weasel out of your accusations. It might mean failing to concede when they offer you their counterarguments. People rarely have more than four at hand. If you remain unmoved, they get angry, or cry, or run away.

"Today, most scholars of culture have concluded that the opposite is true. Every culture has its typical beliefs, norms and values, but these are in constant flux. The culture may transform itself in response to changes in its environment or through interaction with neighbouring cultures. But cultures also undergo transitions due to their own internal dynamics. Even a completely isolated culture existing in an ecologically stable environment cannot avoid change. Unlike the laws of physics, which are free of inconsistencies, every man-made order is packed with internal contradictions. Cultures are constantly trying to reconcile these contradictions, and this process fuels change.",Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,B00ICN066A,,yellow,,location,2541,2018-06-10 04:56:00+00:00
"Money has an even darker side. For although money builds universal trust between strangers, this trust is invested not in humans, communities or sacred values, but in money itself and in the impersonal systems that back it. We do not trust the stranger, or the next-door neighbour – we trust the coin they hold. If they run out of coins, we run out of trust. As money brings down the dams of community, religion and state, the world is in danger of becoming one big and rather heartless marketplace. Hence the economic history of humankind is a delicate dance. People rely on money to facilitate cooperation with strangers, but they’re afraid it will corrupt human values and intimate relations. With one hand people willingly destroy the communal dams that held at bay the movement of money and commerce for so long. Yet with the other hand they build new dams to protect society, religion and the environment from enslavement to market forces.",Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,B00ICN066A,,yellow,,location,2922,2018-06-10 04:56:00+00:00

It was only 400,000 years ago that several species of man began to hunt large game on a regular basis, and only in the last 100,000 years – with the rise of Homo sapiens – that man jumped to the top of the food chain. That spectacular leap from the middle to the top had enormous consequences. Other animals at the top of the pyramid, such as lions and sharks, evolved into that position very gradually, over millions of years. This enabled the ecosystem to develop checks and balances that prevent lions and sharks from wreaking too much havoc. As lions became deadlier, so gazelles evolved to run faster, hyenas to cooperate better, and rhinoceroses to be more bad-tempered. In contrast, humankind ascended to the top so quickly that the ecosystem was not given time to adjust. Moreover, humans themselves failed to adjust. Most top predators of the planet are majestic creatures. Millions of years of dominion have filled them with self-confidence. Sapiens by contrast is more like a banana republic dictator. Having so recently been one of the underdogs of the savannah, we are full of fears and anxieties over our position, which makes us doubly cruel and dangerous. Many historical calamities, from deadly wars to ecological catastrophes, have resulted from this over-hasty jump.",Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,B00ICN066A,,yellow,,location,220,2018-06-10 04:56:00+00:00
"What we do know, however, is that during the last century gender roles have undergone a tremendous revolution. More and more societies today not only give men and women equal legal status, political rights and economic opportunities, but also completely rethink their most basic conceptions of gender and sexuality. Though the gender gap is still significant, events have been moving at a breathtaking speed. At the beginning of the twentieth century the idea of giving voting rights to women was generally seen in the USA as outrageous; the prospect of a female cabinet secretary or Supreme Court justice was simply ridiculous; whereas homosexuality was such a taboo subject that it could not even be openly discussed.

"The cultural ideas spread by empire were seldom the exclusive creation of the ruling elite. Since the imperial vision tends to be universal and inclusive, it was relatively easy for imperial elites to adopt ideas, norms and traditions from wherever they found them, rather than to stick fanatically to a single hidebound tradition. While some emperors sought to purify their cultures and return to what they viewed as their roots, for the most part empires have begot hybrid civilisations that absorbed much from their subject peoples. The imperial culture of Rome was Greek almost as much as Roman. The imperial Abbasid culture was part Persian, part Greek, part Arab. Imperial Mongol culture was a Chinese copycat.

"Human cultures are in constant flux. Is this flux completely random, or does it have some overall pattern? In other words, does history have a direction? The answer is yes. Over the millennia, small, simple cultures gradually coalesce into bigger and more complex civilisations, so that the world contains fewer and fewer mega-cultures, each of which is bigger and more complex. This is of course a very crude generalisation, true only at the macro level. At the micro level, it seems that for every group of cultures that coalesces into a mega-culture, there’s a mega-culture that breaks up into pieces. The Mongol Empire expanded to dominate a huge swathe of Asia and even parts of Europe, only to shatter into fragments. Christianity converted hundreds of millions of people at the same time that it splintered into innumerable sects. The Latin language spread through western and central Europe, then split into local dialects that themselves eventually became national languages.

"For instance, in medieval Europe the nobility believed in both Christianity and chivalry. A typical nobleman went to church in the morning, and listened as the priest held forth on the lives of the saints. ‘Vanity of vanities,’ said the priest, ‘all is vanity. Riches, lust and honour are dangerous temptations. You must rise above them, and follow in Christ’s footsteps. Be meek like Him, avoid violence and extravagance, and if attacked – just turn the other cheek.’ Returning home in a meek and pensive mood, the nobleman would change into his best silks and go to a banquet in his lord’s castle. There the wine flowed like water, the minstrel sang of Lancelot and Guinevere, and the guests exchanged dirty jokes and bloody war tales. ‘It is better to die,’ declared the barons, ‘than to live with shame. If someone questions your honour, only blood can wipe out the insult.

"The slave trade was not controlled by any state or government. It was a purely economic enterprise, organised and financed by the free market according to the laws of supply and demand. Private slave-trading companies sold shares on the Amsterdam, London and Paris stock exchanges. Middle-class Europeans looking for a good investment bought these shares. Relying on this money, the companies bought ships, hired sailors and soldiers, purchased slaves in Africa, and transported them to America. There they sold the slaves to the plantation owners, using the proceeds to purchase plantation products such as sugar, cocoa, coffee, tobacco, cotton and rum. They returned to Europe, sold the sugar and cotton for a good price, and then sailed to Africa to begin another round. The shareholders were very pleased with this arrangement. Throughout the eighteenth century the yield on slave-trade investments was about 6 per cent a year – they were extremely profitable, as any modern consultant would be quick to admit. This is the fly in the ointment of free-market capitalism. It cannot ensure that profits are gained in a fair way, or distributed in a fair manner. On the contrary, the craving to increase profits and production blinds people to anything that might stand in the way. When growth becomes a supreme good, unrestricted by any other ethical considerations, it can easily lead to catastrophe. Some religions, such as Christianity and Nazism, have killed millions out of burning hatred. Capitalism has killed millions out of cold indifference coupled with greed. The Atlantic slave trade did not stem from racist hatred towards Africans. The individuals who bought the shares, the brokers who sold them, and the managers of the slave-trade companies rarely thought about the Africans. Nor did the owners of the sugar plantations. Many owners lived far from their plantations, and the only information they demanded were neat ledgers of profits and losses.",Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,B00ICN066A,,yellow,,location,5169,2018-06-10 04:56:00+00:00

But the hierarchy of rich and poor – which mandates that rich people live in separate and more luxurious neighbourhoods, study in separate and more prestigious schools, and receive medical treatment in separate and better-equipped facilities – seems perfectly sensible to many Americans and Europeans.

Much like the Agricultural Revolution, so too the growth of the modern economy might turn out to be a colossal fraud. The human species and the global economy may well keep growing, but many more individuals may live in hunger and want. Capitalism has two answers to this criticism. First, capitalism has created a world that nobody but a capitalist is capable of running. The only serious attempt to manage the world differently – Communism – was so much worse in almost every conceivable way that nobody has the stomach to try again.

"The most famous Dutch joint-stock company, the Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie, or VOC for short, was chartered in 1602, just as the Dutch were throwing off Spanish rule and the boom of Spanish artillery could still be heard not far from Amsterdam’s ramparts. VOC used the money it raised from selling shares to build ships, send them to Asia, and bring back Chinese, Indian and Indonesian goods. It also financed military actions taken by company ships against competitors and pirates. Eventually VOC money financed the conquest of Indonesia. Indonesia is the world’s biggest archipelago. Its thousands upon thousands of islands were ruled in the early seventeenth century by hundreds of kingdoms, principalities, sultanates and tribes. When VOC merchants first arrived in Indonesia in 1603, their aims were strictly commercial. However, in order to secure their commercial interests and maximise the profits of the shareholders, VOC merchants began to fight against local potentates who charged inflated tariffs, as well as against European competitors. VOC armed its merchant ships with cannons; it recruited European, Japanese, Indian and Indonesian mercenaries; and it built forts and conducted full-scale battles and sieges. This enterprise may sound a little strange to us, but in the early modern age it was common for private companies to hire not only soldiers, but also generals and admirals, cannons and ships, and even entire off-the-shelf armies. The international community took this for granted and didn’t raise an eyebrow when a private company established an empire. Island after island fell to VOC mercenaries and a large part of Indonesia became a VOC colony. VOC ruled Indonesia for close to 200 years. Only in 1800 did the Dutch state assume control of Indonesia, making it a Dutch national colony for the following 150 years.

"Who was responsible? Neither kings, nor priests, nor merchants. The culprits were a handful of plant species, including wheat, rice and potatoes. These plants domesticated Homo sapiens, rather than vice versa. Think for a moment about the Agricultural Revolution from the viewpoint of wheat. Ten thousand years ago wheat was just a wild grass, one of many, confined to a small range in the Middle East. Suddenly, within just a few short millennia, it was growing all over the world. According to the basic evolutionary criteria of survival and reproduction, wheat has become one of the most successful plants in the history of the earth. In areas such as the Great Plains of North America, where not a single wheat stalk grew 10,000 years ago, you can today walk for hundreds upon hundreds of miles without encountering any other plant. Worldwide, wheat covers about 870,000 square miles of the globe’s surface, almost ten times the size of Britain. How did this grass turn from insignificant to ubiquitous? Wheat did it by manipulating Homo sapiens to its advantage. This ape had been living a fairly comfortable life hunting and gathering until about 10,000 years ago, but then began to invest more and more effort in cultivating wheat. Within a couple of millennia, humans in many parts of the world were doing little from dawn to dusk other than taking care of wheat plants. It wasn’t easy. Wheat demanded a lot of them. Wheat didn’t like rocks and pebbles, so Sapiens broke their backs clearing fields. Wheat didn’t like sharing its space, water and nutrients with other plants, so men and women laboured long days weeding under the scorching sun. Wheat got sick, so Sapiens had to keep a watch out for worms and blight. Wheat was attacked by rabbits and locust swarms, so the farmers built fences and stood guard over the fields. Wheat was thirsty, so humans dug irrigation canals or lugged heavy buckets from the well to water it.

The Cognitive Revolution and the Agricultural Revolution did not change that. They glued together families and communities to create tribes, cities, kingdoms and empires, but families and communities remained the basic building blocks of all human societies.

Conquest merely utilised and spread their view of the world. The Arabs, to name one example, did not conquer Egypt, Spain or India in order to discover something they did not know. The Romans, Mongols and Aztecs voraciously conquered new lands in search of power and wealth – not of knowledge.

The state sent its policemen to stop family vendettas and replace them with court decisions. The market sent its hawkers to wipe out longstanding local traditions and replace them with ever-changing commercial fashions. Yet this was not enough. In order really to break the power of family and community, they needed the help of a fifth column. The state and the market approached people with an offer that could not be refused. ‘Become individuals,’ they said. ‘Marry whomever you desire, without asking permission from your parents. Take up whatever job suits you, even if community elders frown. Live wherever you wish, even if you cannot make it every week to the family dinner.

"But this approach also seems to be belied by the empirical evidence. Particularly problematic is the assumption that women’s dependence on external help made them dependent on men, rather than on other women, and that male competitiveness made men socially dominant. There are many species of animals, such as elephants and bonobo chimpanzees, in which the dynamics between dependent females and competitive males results in a matriarchal society. Since females need external help, they are obliged to develop their social skills and learn how to cooperate and appease. They construct all-female social networks that help each member raise her children. Males, meanwhile, spend their time fighting and competing. Their social skills and social bonds remain underdeveloped. Bonobo and elephant societies are controlled by strong networks of cooperative females, while the self-centred and uncooperative males are pushed to the sidelines.

"In truth, our concepts ‘natural’ and ‘unnatural’ are taken not from biology, but from Christian theology. The theological meaning of ‘natural’ is ‘in accordance with the intentions of the God who created nature’. Christian theologians argued that God created the human body, intending each limb and organ to serve a particular purpose. If we use our limbs and organs for the purpose envisioned by God, then it is a natural activity. To use them differently than God intends is unnatural. But evolution has no purpose. Organs have not evolved with a purpose, and the way they are used is in constant flux. There is not a single organ in the human body that only does the job its prototype did when it first appeared hundreds of millions of years ago. Organs evolve to perform a particular function, but once they exist, they can be adapted for other usages as well. Mouths, for example, appeared because the earliest multicellular organisms needed a way to take nutrients into their bodies. We still use our mouths for that purpose, but we also use them to kiss, speak and, if we are Rambo, to pull the pins out of hand grenades. Are any of these uses unnatural simply because our worm-like ancestors 600 million years ago didn’t do those things with their mouths?",Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,B00ICN066A,,yellow,,location,2352,2018-06-10 04:56:00+00:00

Most great empires extended their control only over their immediate neighbourhood – they reached far-flung lands simply because their neighbourhood kept expanding. Thus the Romans conquered Etruria in order to defend Rome (c.350–300 BC). They then conquered the Po Valley in order to defend Etruria (c.200 BC). They subsequently conquered Provence to defend the Po Valley (c.120 BC), Gaul to defend Provence (c.50 BC), and Britain in order to defend Gaul (c. AD 50).

We are all responsible for each other, but not responsible for them. We were always distinct from them, and owe them nothing.

"Romantic literature often presents the individual as somebody caught in a struggle against the state and the market. Nothing could be further from the truth. The state and the market are the mother and father of the individual, and the individual can survive only thanks to them. The market provides us with work, insurance and a pension. If we want to study a profession, the government’s schools are there to teach us. If we want to open a business, the bank loans us money. If we want to build a house, a construction company builds it and the bank gives us a mortgage, in some cases subsidised or insured by the state. If violence flares up, the police protect us. If we are sick for a few days, our health insurance takes care of us. If we are debilitated for months, national social services steps in. If we need around-the-clock assistance, we can go to the market and hire a nurse – usually some stranger from the other side of the world who takes care of us with the kind of devotion that we no longer expect from our own children. If we have the means, we can spend our golden years at a senior citizens’ home. The tax authorities treat us as individuals, and do not expect us to pay the neighbours’ taxes. The courts, too, see us as individuals, and never punish us for the crimes of our cousins. Not only adult men, but also women and children, are recognised as individuals. Throughout most of history, women were often seen as the property of family or community. Modern states, on the other hand, see women as individuals, enjoying economic and legal rights independently of their family and community. They may hold their own bank accounts, decide whom to marry, and even choose to divorce or live on their own. But the liberation of the individual comes at a cost. Many of us now bewail the loss of strong families and communities and feel alienated and threatened by the power the impersonal state and market wield over our lives. States and markets composed of alienated individuals can intervene in the lives of their members much more easily than states and markets composed of strong families and communities. When neighbours in a high-rise apartment building cannot even agree on how much to pay their janitor, how can we expect them to resist the state? The deal between states, markets and individuals is an uneasy one. The state and the market disagree about their mutual rights and obligations, and individuals complain that both demand too much and provide too little. In many cases individuals are exploited by markets, and states employ their armies, police forces and bureaucracies to persecute individuals instead of defending them. Yet it is amazing that this deal works at all – however imperfectly. For it breaches countless generations of human social arrangements.

"The last 300 years are often depicted as an age of growing secularism, in which religions have increasingly lost their importance. If we are talking about theist religions, this is largely correct. But if we take into consideration natural-law religions, then modernity turns out to be an age of intense religious fervour, unparalleled missionary efforts, and the bloodiest wars of religion in history. The modern age has witnessed the rise of a number of new natural-law religions, such as liberalism, Communism, capitalism, nationalism and Nazism. These creeds do not like to be called religions, and refer to themselves as ideologies. But this is just a semantic exercise. If a religion is a system of human norms and values that is founded on belief in a superhuman order, then Soviet Communism was no less a religion than Islam. Islam is of course different from Communism, because Islam sees the superhuman order governing the world as the edict of an omnipotent creator god, whereas Soviet Communism did not believe in gods. But Buddhism too gives short shrift to gods, and yet we commonly classify it as a religion. Like Buddhists, Communists believed in a superhuman order of natural and immutable laws that should guide human actions. Whereas Buddhists believe that the law of nature was discovered by Siddhartha Gautama, Communists believed that the law of nature was discovered by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. The similarity does not end there. Like other religions, Communism too has its holy scripts and prophetic books, such as Marx’s Das Kapital, which foretold that history would soon end with the inevitable victory of the proletariat. Communism had its holidays and festivals, such as the First of May and the anniversary of the October Revolution. It had theologians adept at Marxist dialectics, and every unit in the Soviet army had a chaplain, called a commissar, who monitored the piety of soldiers and officers. Communism had martyrs, holy wars and heresies, such as Trotskyism. Soviet Communism was a fanatical and missionary religion.

"The benefits were sometimes salient – law enforcement, urban planning, standardisation of weights and measures – and sometimes questionable – taxes, conscription, emperor worship. But most imperial elites earnestly believed that they were working for the general welfare of all the empire’s inhabitants. China’s ruling class treated their country’s neighbours and its foreign subjects as miserable barbarians to whom the empire must bring the benefits of culture. The Mandate of Heaven was bestowed upon the emperor not in order to exploit the world, but in order to educate humanity. The Romans, too, justified their dominion by arguing that they were endowing the barbarians with peace, justice and refinement. The wild Germans and painted Gauls had lived in squalor and ignorance until the Romans tamed them with law, cleaned them up in public bathhouses, and improved them with philosophy. The Mauryan Empire in the third century BC took as its mission the dissemination of Buddha’s teachings to an ignorant world.

"Two thousand years of monotheistic brainwashing have caused most Westerners to see polytheism as ignorant and childish idolatry. This is an unjust stereotype. In order to understand the inner logic of polytheism, it is necessary to grasp the central idea buttressing the belief in many gods. Polytheism does not necessarily dispute the existence of a single power or law governing the entire universe. In fact, most polytheist and even animist religions recognised such a supreme power that stands behind all the different gods, demons and holy rocks. In classical Greek polytheism, Zeus, Hera, Apollo and their colleagues were subject to an omnipotent and all-encompassing power – Fate (Moira, Ananke). Nordic gods, too, were in thrall to fate, which doomed them to perish in the cataclysm of Ragnarök (the Twilight of the Gods). In the polytheistic religion of the Yoruba of West Africa, all gods were born of the supreme god Olodumare, and remained subject to him. In Hindu polytheism, a single principle, Atman, controls the myriad gods and spirits, humankind, and the biological and physical world. Atman is the eternal essence or soul of the entire universe, as well as of every individual and every phenomenon. The fundamental insight of polytheism, which distinguishes it from monotheism, is that the supreme power governing the world is devoid of interests and biases, and therefore it is unconcerned with the mundane desires, cares and worries of humans. It’s pointless to ask this power for victory in war, for health or for rain, because from its all-encompassing vantage point, it makes no difference whether a particular kingdom wins or loses, whether a particular city prospers or withers, whether a particular person recuperates or dies. The Greeks did not waste any sacrifices on Fate, and Hindus built no temples to Atman. The only reason to approach the supreme power of the universe would be to renounce all desires and embrace the bad along with the good – to embrace even defeat, poverty, sickness and death. Thus some Hindus, known as Sadhus or Sannyasis, devote their lives to uniting with Atman, thereby achieving enlightenment. They strive to see the world from the viewpoint of this fundamental principle, to realise that from its eternal perspective all mundane desires and fears are meaningless and ephemeral phenomena. Most Hindus, however, are not Sadhus. They are sunk deep in the morass of mundane concerns, where Atman is not much help. For assistance in such matters, Hindus approach the gods with their partial powers. Precisely because their powers are partial rather than all-encompassing, gods such as Ganesha, Lakshmi and Saraswati have interests and biases. Humans can therefore make deals with these partial powers and rely on their help in order to win wars and recuperate from illness. There are necessarily many of these smaller powers, since once you start dividing up the all-encompassing power of a supreme principle, you’ll inevitably end up with…",Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,B00ICN066A,,yellow,,location,3315,2018-06-10 04:56:00+00:00

"Furthermore, the new knowledge accumulated by the empires made it possible, at least in theory, to benefit the conquered populations and bring them the benefits of ‘progress’ – to provide them with medicine and education, to build railroads and canals, to ensure justice and prosperity. Imperialists claimed that their empires were not vast enterprises of exploitation but rather altruistic projects conducted for the sake of the non-European races – in Rudyard Kipling’s words, ‘the White Man’s burden’:                       Take up the White Man’s burden –                       Send forth the best ye breed –                       Go bind your sons to exile                       To serve your captives’ need;                       To wait in heavy harness,                       On fluttered folk and wild –                       Your new-caught, sullen peoples,                       Half-devil and half-child.

"We still talk a lot about ‘authentic’ cultures, but if by ‘authentic’ we mean something that developed independently, and that consists of ancient local traditions free of external influences, then there are no authentic cultures left on earth. Over the last few centuries, all cultures were changed almost beyond recognition by a flood of global influences. One of the most interesting examples of this globalisation is ‘ethnic’ cuisine. In an Italian restaurant we expect to find spaghetti in tomato sauce; in Polish and Irish restaurants lots of potatoes; in an Argentinian restaurant we can choose between dozens of kinds of beefsteaks; in an Indian restaurant hot chillies are incorporated into just about everything; and the highlight at any Swiss café is thick hot chocolate under an alp of whipped cream. But none of these foods is native to those nations. Tomatoes, chilli peppers and cocoa are all Mexican in origin; they reached Europe and Asia only after the Spaniards conquered Mexico. Julius Caesar and Dante Alighieri never twirled tomato-drenched spaghetti on their forks (even forks hadn’t been invented yet), William Tell never tasted chocolate, and Buddha never spiced up his food with chilli. Potatoes reached Poland and Ireland no more than 400 years ago.

"Thanks to the work of people like William Jones and Henry Rawlinson, the European conquerors knew their empires very well. Far better, indeed, than any previous conquerors, or even than the native population itself. Their superior knowledge had obvious practical advantages. Without such knowledge, it is unlikely that a ridiculously small number of Britons could have succeeded in governing, oppressing and exploiting so many hundreds of millions of Indians for two centuries. Throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, fewer than 5,000 British officials, about 40,000–70,000 British soldiers, and perhaps another 100,000 British business people, hangers-on, wives and children were sufficient to conquer and rule up to 300 million Indians.9",Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,B00ICN066A,,yellow,,location,4679,2018-06-10 04:56:00+00:00

"The only humanist sect that has actually broken loose from traditional monotheism is evolutionary humanism, whose most famous representatives are the Nazis. What distinguished the Nazis from other humanist sects was a different definition of ‘humanity’, one deeply influenced by the theory of evolution. In contrast to other humanists, the Nazis believed that humankind is not something universal and eternal, but rather a mutable species that can evolve or degenerate. Man can evolve into superman, or degenerate into a subhuman. The main ambition of the Nazis was to protect humankind from degeneration and encourage its progressive evolution. This is why the Nazis said that the Aryan race, the most advanced form of humanity, had to be protected and fostered, while degenerate kinds of Homo sapiens like Jews, Roma, homosexuals and the mentally ill had to be quarantined and even exterminated. The Nazis explained that Homo sapiens itself appeared when one ‘superior’ population of ancient humans evolved, whereas ‘inferior’ populations such as the Neanderthals became extinct. These different populations were at first no more than different races, but developed independently along their own evolutionary paths. This might well happen again. According to the Nazis, Homo sapiens had already divided into several distinct races, each with its own unique qualities. One of these races, the Aryan race, had the finest qualities – rationalism, beauty, integrity, diligence. The Aryan race therefore had the potential to turn man into superman. Other races, such as Jews and blacks, were today’s Neanderthals, possessing inferior qualities. If allowed to breed, and in particular to intermarry with Aryans, they would adulterate all human populations and doom Homo sapiens to extinction.",Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,B00ICN066A,,yellow,,location,3610,2018-06-10 04:56:00+00:00

"Another important sect is socialist humanism. Socialists believe that ‘humanity’ is collective rather than individualistic. They hold as sacred not the inner voice of each individual, but the species Homo sapiens as a whole. Whereas liberal humanism seeks as much freedom as possible for individual humans, socialist humanism seeks equality between all humans. According to socialists, inequality is the worst blasphemy against the sanctity of humanity, because it privileges peripheral qualities of humans over their universal essence. For example, when the rich are privileged over the poor, it means that we value money more than the universal essence of all humans, which is the same for rich and poor alike. Like liberal humanism, socialist humanism is built on monotheist foundations.

The conquered no longer saw the empire as an alien system of occupation, and the conquerors came to view their subjects as equal to themselves. Rulers and ruled alike came to see ‘them’ as ‘us’. All the subjects of Rome eventually, after centuries of imperial rule, were granted Roman citizenship. Non-Romans rose to occupy the top ranks in the officer corps of the Roman legions and were appointed to the Senate.

"Such racist theories, prominent and respectable for many decades, have become anathema among scientists and politicians alike. People continue to conduct a heroic struggle against racism without noticing that the battlefront has shifted, and that the place of racism in imperial ideology has now been replaced by ‘culturism’. There is no such word, but it’s about time we coined it. Among today’s elites, assertions about the contrasting merits of diverse human groups are almost always couched in terms of historical differences between cultures rather than biological differences between races. We no longer say, ‘It’s in their blood.’ We say, ‘It’s in their culture.’ Thus European right-wing parties which oppose Muslim immigration usually take care to avoid racial terminology. Marine le Pen’s speechwriters would have been shown the door on the spot had they suggested that the leader of France’s Front National party go on television to declare that, ‘We don’t want those inferior Semites to dilute our Aryan blood and spoil our Aryan civilisation.’ Instead, the French Front National, the Dutch Party for Freedom, the Alliance for the Future of Austria and their like tend to argue that Western culture, as it has evolved in Europe, is characterised by democratic values, tolerance and gender equality, whereas Muslim culture, which evolved in the Middle East, is characterised by hierarchical politics, fanaticism and misogyny. Since the two cultures are so different, and since many Muslim immigrants are unwilling (and perhaps unable) to adopt Western values, they should not be allowed to enter, lest they foment internal conflicts and corrode European democracy and liberalism. Such culturist arguments are fed by scientific studies in the humanities and social sciences that highlight the so-called clash of civilisations and the fundamental differences between different cultures. Not all historians and anthropologists accept these theories or support their political usages. But whereas biologists today have an easy time disavowing racism, simply explaining that the biological differences between present-day human populations are trivial, it is harder for historians and anthropologists to disavow culturism. After all, if the differences between human cultures are trivial, why should we pay historians and anthropologists to study them?",Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,B00ICN066A,,yellow,,location,4728,2018-06-10 04:56:00+00:00

No matter what their origins, nearly all the inhabitants of the two American continents, from Alaska’s Barrow Peninsula to the Straits of Magellan, communicate in one of four imperial languages: Spanish, Portuguese, French or English. Present-day Egyptians speak Arabic, think of themselves as Arabs, and identify wholeheartedly with the Arab Empire that conquered Egypt in the seventh century and crushed with an iron fist the repeated revolts that broke out against its rule. About 10 million Zulus in South Africa hark back to the Zulu age of glory in the nineteenth century, even though most of them descend from tribes who fought against the Zulu Empire, and were incorporated into it only through bloody military campaigns.",Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,B00ICN066A,,yellow,,location,3036,2018-06-10 04:56:00+00:00
"Even if we were to completely disavow the legacy of a brutal empire in the hope of reconstructing and safeguarding the ‘authentic’ cultures that preceded it, in all probability what we will be defending is nothing but the legacy of an older and no less brutal empire. Those who resent the mutilation of Indian culture by the British Raj inadvertently sanctify the legacies of the Mughal Empire and the conquering sultanate of Delhi. And whoever attempts to rescue ‘authentic Indian culture’ from the alien influences of these Muslim empires sanctifies the legacies of the Gupta Empire, the Kushan Empire and the Maurya Empire.

They were so successful that billions of people gradually adopted significant parts of that culture. Indians, Africans, Arabs, Chinese and Maoris learned French, English and Spanish.

"Yet there has always been a chasm between theological theories and historical realities. Most people have found it difficult to digest the monotheist idea fully. They have continued to divide the world into ‘we’ and ‘they’, and to see the supreme power of the universe as too distant and alien for their mundane needs. The monotheist religions expelled the gods through the front door with a lot of fanfare, only to take them back in through the side window. Christianity, for example, developed its own pantheon of saints, whose cults differed little from those of the polytheistic gods. Just as the god Jupiter defended Rome and Huitzilopochtli protected the Aztec Empire, so every Christian kingdom had its own patron saint who helped it overcome difficulties and win wars. England was protected by St George, Scotland by St Andrew, Hungary by St Stephen, and France had St Martin. Cities and towns, professions, and even diseases – each had their own saint. The city of Milan had St Ambrose, while St Mark watched over Venice. St Florian protected chimney cleaners, whereas St Mathew lent a hand to tax collectors in distress. If you suffered from headaches you had to pray to St Agathius, but if from toothaches, then St Apollonia was a much better audience. The Christian saints did not merely resemble the old polytheistic gods. Often they were these very same gods in disguise. For example, the chief goddess of Celtic Ireland prior to the coming of Christianity was Brigid. When Ireland was Christianised, Brigid too was baptised. She became St Brigit, who to this day is the most revered saint in Catholic Ireland.",Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,B00ICN066A,,yellow,,location,3411,2018-06-10 04:56:00+00:00

By 7000 BC the town of Çatalhöyük in Anatolia numbered between 5,000 and 10,000 individuals. It may well have been the world’s biggest settlement at the time. During the fifth and fourth millennia BC, cities with tens of thousands of inhabitants sprouted in the Fertile Crescent, and each of these held sway over many nearby villages. In 3100 BC the entire lower Nile Valley was united into the first Egyptian kingdom. Its pharaohs ruled thousands of square miles and hundreds of thousands of people. Around 2250 BC Sargon the Great forged the first empire, the Akkadian. It boasted over a million subjects and a standing army of 5,400 soldiers.

"Only in the twentieth century did non-European cultures adopt a truly global vision. This was one of the crucial factors that led to the collapse of European hegemony. Thus in the Algerian War of Independence (1954–62), Algerian guerrillas defeated a French army with an overwhelming numerical, technological and economic advantage. The Algerians prevailed because they were supported by a global anti-colonial network, and because they worked out how to harness the world’s media to their cause – as well as public opinion in France itself. The defeat that little North Vietnam inflicted on the American colossus was based on a similar strategy. These guerrilla forces showed that even superpowers could be defeated if a local struggle became a global cause.

"My return, therefore, to this place, in peace, among the same people, was strange enough of itself, but that I should, when there, be formally invited by Capt. Thomas Auld, then over eighty years old, to come to the side of his dying bed, evidently with a view to a friendly talk over our past relations, was a fact still more strange, and one which, until its occurrence, I could never have thought possible. To me, Capt. Auld had sustained the relation of master—a relation which I had held in extremest abhorrence, and which, for forty years, I had denounced in all bitterness of spirit and fierceness of speech. He had struck down my personality, had subjected me to his will, made property of my body and soul, reduced me to a chattel, hired me out to a noted slave breaker to be worked like a beast and flogged into submission; he had taken my hard earnings, sent me to prison, offered me for sale, broken up my Sunday-school, forbidden me to teach my fellow slaves to read on pain of nine and thirty lashes on my bare back; he had sold my body to his brother Hugh, and pocketed the price of my flesh and blood without any apparent disturbance of his conscience. ... Had I been asked in the days of slavery to visit this man, I should have regarded the invitation as one to put fetters on my ankles and handcuffs on my wrists. It would have been an invitation to the auction-block and the slave whip. I had no business with this man under the old regime but to keep out of his way. But now that slavery was destroyed, and the slave and the master stood upon equal ground, I was not only willing to meet him, but was very glad to do so. The conditions were favorable for remembrance of all his good deeds, and generous extenuation of all his evil ones. He was to me no longer a slaveholder either in fact or in spirit, and I regarded him as I did myself, a victim of the circumstances of birth, education, law, and custom.",The Life and Times of Frederick Douglas (The Autobiographies #3),Frederick Douglass,B00BIFLSUW,,yellow,,location,6631,2018-07-24 04:56:00+00:00
"Mr. Lincoln had reason to look forward to a peaceful and happy term of office. To all appearance, we were on the eve of a restoration of the union, and a solid and lasting peace. He had served one term as President of the Disunited States, he was now for the first time to be President of the United States. Heavy had been his burden, hard had been his toil, bitter had been his trials, and terrible had been his anxiety; but the future seemed now bright and full of hope. Richmond had fallen, Grant had General Lee and the army of Virginia firmly in his clutch; Sherman had fought and found his way from the banks of the great river to the shores of the sea, leaving the two ends of the rebellion squirming and twisting in agony, like the severed parts of a serpent, doomed to inevitable death; and now there was but a little time longer for the good President to bear his burden, and be the target of reproach. ... A country, redeemed and regenerated from the foulest crime against human nature that ever saw the sun! What a bright vision of peace, prosperity, and and happiness must have come to that tired and over-worked brain, and weary spirit. Men used to talk of his jokes, and he no doubt indulged them, but I seemed never to have the faculty of calling them to the surface. I saw him oftener than many who hare reported him, but I never saw any levity in him. He always impressed me as a strong, earnest man, having no time or disposition to trifle; grappling with all his might the work he had in hand. The expression of his face was a blending of suffering with patience and fortitude. Men called him homely, and homely he was; but it was manifestly a human homeliness, for there was nothing of the tiger or other wild animal about him. His eyes had in them the tenderness of motherhood, and his mouth and other features the highest perfection of a genuine manhood. His picture, now before me in my study, by Marshall, corresponds well with the impression I have of him. But, alas! what are all good and great qualities; what are human hopes and human happiness to the revengeful hand of an assassin? What are sweet dreams of peace; what are visions of the future? A simple leaden bullet, and a few grains of powder, in the shortest limit of time, are sufficient to blast and ruin all that is precious in human existence, not alone of the murdered, but of the murderer.

"of civilization against barbarism. The Proclamation itself was like Mr. Lincoln throughout. It was framed with a view to the least harm and the most good possible in the circumstances, and with especial consideration of the latter. It was thoughtful, cautious, and well guarded at all points. While he hated Slavery, and really desired its destruction, he always proceeded against it in a manner the least likely to shock or drive from him any who were truly in sympathy with the preservation of the union, but who were not friendly to Emancipation. For this he kept up the distinction between loyal and disloyal slaveholders, and discriminated in favor of the one, as against the other. ... The old cry was raised by the copperhead organs of “an abolition war,” and a pretext was thus found for an excuse for refusing to enlist, and for marshaling all the negro prejudice of the north on the rebel side. Men could say they were willing to fight for the union, but that they were not willing to fight for the freedom of the negroes; and thus it was made difficult to procure enlistments or to enforce the draft. This was especially true of New York, where there was a large Irish population. The attempt to enforce the draft in that city was met by mobs, riot, and bloodshed. There is perhaps no darker chapter in the whole history of the war, than this cowardly and bloody uprising in July, 1863. For three days and nights New York was in the hands of a ferocious mob, and there was not sufficient power in the government of the country or of the city itself, to stay the hand of violence, and the effusion of blood. Though this mob was nominally against the draft which had been ordered, it poured out its fiercest wrath upon the colored people and their friends. It spared neither age nor sex; it hanged negroes simply because they were negroes, it murdered women in their homes, and burned their homes over their heads, it dashed out the brains of young children against the lamp posts, it burned the colored orphan asylum, a noble charity on the corner of 5th ave., and scarce allowing time for the helpless two hundred children to make good their escape, plundering the building of every valuable piece of furniture; and colored men, women, and children were forced to seek concealment in cellars or garrets or wheresoever else it could be found until this high carnival of crime and reign of terror should pass away.",The Life and Times of Frederick Douglas (The Autobiographies #3),Frederick Douglass,B00BIFLSUW,,yellow,,location,5265,2018-07-24 04:56:00+00:00
"Mrs. Sophia was naturally of an excellent disposition— kind, gentle, and cheerful. The supercilious contempt for the rights and feelings of others, and the petulance and bad humor which generally characterized slaveholding ladies, were all quite absent from her manner and bearing toward me. She had never been a slaveholder—a thing then quite unusual at the South—but had depended almost entirely upon her own industry for a living. To this fact the dear lady no doubt owed the excellent preservation of her natural goodness of heart, for slavery could change a saint into a sinner, and an angel into a demon. ... With an unconsciousness and inexperience equal to my own, she readily consented, and in an incredibly short time, by her kind assistance, I had mastered the alphabet and could spell words of three or four letters. My mistress seemed almost as proud of my progress as if I had been her own child, and supposing that her husband would be as well pleased, she made no secret of what she was doing for me. Indeed, she exultingly told him of the aptness of her pupil, and of her intention to persevere in teaching me, as she felt her duty to do, at least to read the Bible. And here arose the first dark cloud over my Baltimore prospects, the precursor of chilling blasts and drenching storms. Master Hugh was astounded beyond measure, and probably for the first time proceeded to unfold to his wife the true philosophy of the slave system, and the peculiar rules necessary in the nature of the case to be observed in the management of human chattels. Of course he forbade her to give me any further instruction, telling her in the first place that to do so was unlawful, as it was also unsafe; “for,” said he, “if you give a nigger an inch he will take an ell. Learning will spoil the best nigger in the world. If he learns to read the Bible it will forever unfit him to be a slave. He should know nothing but the will of his master, and learn to obey it. As to himself, learning will do him no good, but a great deal of harm, making him disconsolate and unhappy. If you teach him how to read, he’ll want to know how to write, and this accomplished, he’ll be running away with himself.”",The Life and Times of Frederick Douglas (The Autobiographies #3),Frederick Douglass,B00BIFLSUW,,yellow,,location,939,2018-07-24 04:56:00+00:00
"The close-fisted stinginess that fed the poor slave on coarse corn-meal and tainted meat, that clothed him in crashy tow-linen and hurried him on to toil through the field in all weathers, with wind and rain beating through his tattered garments, that scarcely gave even the young slave-mother time to nurse her infant in the fence-corner, wholly vanished on approaching the sacred precincts of the “Great House” itself.

"One of the first circumstances that opened my eyes to the cruelties and wickedness of slavery and its hardening influences upon my old master, was his refusal to interpose his authority to protect and shield a young woman, a cousin of mine, who had been most cruelly abused and beaten by his overseer in Tuckahoe. ... In one of his moments of drunken madness he committed the outrage which brought the young woman in question down to my old master’s for protection. The poor girl, on her arrival at our house, presented a most pitiable appearance. She had left in haste and without preparation, and probably without the knowledge of Mr. Plummer. She had traveled twelve miles, bare-footed. bare-necked, and bare-headed. Her neck and shoulders were covered with scars newly made, and not content with marring her neck and shoulders with the cowhide, the cowardly wretch had dealt her a blow on the head with a hickory club, which cut a horrible gash and left her face literally covered with blood. In this condition the poor young woman came down to implore protection at the hands of my old master. I expected to see him boil over with rage at the revolting deed, and to hear him fill the air with curses upon the brutal Plummer; but I was disappointed. He sternly told her in an angry tone, “She deserved every bit of it, and if she did not go home instantly he would himself take the remaining skin from her neck and back.” Thus the poor girl was compelled to return without redress, and perhaps to receive an additional flogging for daring to appeal to authority higher than that of the overseer. ... This treatment was a part of the system, rather than a part of the man. To have encouraged appeals of this kind would have occasioned much loss of time, and leave the overseer powerless to enforce obedience.",The Life and Times of Frederick Douglas (The Autobiographies #3),Frederick Douglass,B00BIFLSUW,,yellow,,location,494,2018-07-24 04:56:00+00:00

She is now about seventy-four years, but marvelously well preserved. She invited me to a seat by her side, introduced me to her grand-children, conversed with me as freely and with as little embarrassment as if I had been an old acquaintance and occupied an equal station with the most aristocratic of the Caucasian race. I saw in her much of the quiet dignity as well as the features of her father. I spent an hour or so in conversation with Mrs. Buchanan, and when I left a beautiful little grand-daughter of hers, with a pleasant smile on her face, handed me a bouquet of many-colored flowers. I never accepted such a gift with a sweeter sentiment of gratitude than from the hand of this lovely child. It told me many things, and among them that a new dispensation of justice, kindness, and human brotherhood was dawning not only in the North, but in the South; that the war and the slavery that caused the war were things of the past, and that the rising generation are turning their eyes from the sunset of decayed institutions to the grand possibilities of a glorious future.",The Life and Times of Frederick Douglas (The Autobiographies #3),Frederick Douglass,B00BIFLSUW,,yellow,,location,6788,2018-07-24 04:56:00+00:00
"It was the custom in the State of Maryland to require of the free colored people to have what were called free papers. This instrument they were required to renew very often, and by charging a fee for this writing, considerable sums from time to time were collected by the State. In these papers the name, age, color, height, and form of the free man were described, together with any scars or other marks upon his person, which could assist in his identification. This device of slaveholding ingenuity, like other devices of wickedness, in some measure defeated itself —since more than one man could be found to answer the same general description. Hence many slaves could escape by personating the owner of one set of papers; and this was often done as follows: A slave nearly or sufficiently answering the description set forth in the papers, would borrow or hire them till he could by their means escape to a free State, and then, by mail or otherwise, return them to the owner. The operation was a hazardous one for the lender as well as the borrower. A failure on the part of the fugitive to send back the papers would imperil his benefactor, and the discovery of the papers in possession of the wrong man would imperil both the fugitive and his friend. It was therefore an act of supreme trust on the part of a freeman of color thus to put in jeopardy his own liberty that another might be free.

Such racing, we had the sagacity to see, was not likely to pay. We had our times for measuring each other’s strength, but we knew too much to keep up the competition so long as to produce an extraordinary day’s work.

"Dear reader, you can hardly believe the statement, but it is true, and therefore I write it down; no fewer than fifty white men stood by and saw this brutal and shameful outrage committed, and not a man of them all interposed a single word of mercy. There were four against one, and that one’s face was beaten and battered most horribly, and no one said, “that is enough;” but some cried out, “Kill him! kill him! kill the d—n nigger! knock his brains out! he struck a white person!” I mention this inhuman outcry to show the character of the men and the spirit of the times at Gardiner’s ship-yard; and, indeed, in Baltimore generally, in 1836. As I look back to this period, I am almost amazed that I was not murdered outright, so murderous was the spirit which prevailed there.",The Life and Times of Frederick Douglas (The Autobiographies #3),Frederick Douglass,B00BIFLSUW,,yellow,,location,2596,2018-07-24 04:56:00+00:00

"There was no earthly inducement in the slave’s condition to incite him to labor faithfully. The fear of punishment was the sole motive of any sort of industry with him. Knowing this fact as the slaveholder did, and judging the slave by himself, he naturally concluded that the slave would be idle whenever the cause for this fear was absent. Hence all sorts of petty deceptions were practiced to inspire fear.",The Life and Times of Frederick Douglas (The Autobiographies #3),Frederick Douglass,B00BIFLSUW,,yellow,,location,1638,2018-07-24 04:56:00+00:00
"in a slave State an unsuccessful runaway was not only subjected to cruel torture, and sold away to the far South, but he was frequently execrated by the other slaves.

"Any white man, if he pleased, was authorized to stop a man of color on any road, and examine and arrest him. By this arrangement many abuses (considered such even by slaveholders) occurred. Cases have been known where freemen, being called upon to show their free papers by a pack of ruffians, and on the presentation of the papers, the ruffians have torn them up, and seized the victim and sold him to a life of endless bondage.",The Life and Times of Frederick Douglas (The Autobiographies #3),Frederick Douglass,B00BIFLSUW,,yellow,,location,2305,2018-07-24 04:56:00+00:00
"the conflict of slavery with the interests of white mechanics and laborers. In the country this conflict was not so apparent; but in cities, such as Baltimore, Richmond, New Orleans, Mobile, etc., it was seen pretty clearly. The slaveholders, with a craftiness peculiar to themselves, by encouraging the enmity of the poor laboring white man against the blacks, succeeded in making the said white man almost as much a slave as the black slave himself. The difference between the white slave and the black slave was this: the latter belonged to one slaveholder, and the former belonged to the slaveholders collectively. The white slave had taken from him by indirection what the black slave had taken from him directly and without ceremony. Both were plundered, and by the same plunderers. The slave was robbed by his master of all his earnings, above what was required for his bare physical necessities, and the white laboring man was robbed by the slave system, of the just results of his labor, because he was flung into competition with a class of laborers who worked without wages. The slaveholders blinded them to this competition by keeping alive their prejudice against the slaves as men—not against them as slaves.",The Life and Times of Frederick Douglas (The Autobiographies #3),Frederick Douglass,B00BIFLSUW,,yellow,,location,2552,2018-07-24 04:56:00+00:00
"The reader may like to know why, after I had so grievously offended Mr. Covey, he did not have me taken in hand by the authorities; indeed, why the law of Maryland, which assigned hanging to the slave who resisted his master, was not put in force against me; at any rate why I was not taken up, as was usual in such cases, and publicly whipped, as an example to other slaves, and as a means of deterring me from committing the same offense again. I confess that the easy manner in which I got off was always a surprise to me, and even now I cannot fully explain the cause, though the probability is that Covey was ashamed to have it known that he had been mastered by a boy of sixteen.",The Life and Times of Frederick Douglas (The Autobiographies #3),Frederick Douglass,B00BIFLSUW,,yellow,,location,1973,2018-07-24 04:56:00+00:00
"Slaves would sometimes fight with each other, and even die at each other’s hands, but there were very few who were not held in awe by a white man. Trained from the cradle up to think and feel that their masters were superior, and invested with a sort of sacredness, there were few who could rise above the control which that sentiment exercised. I had freed myself from it, and the thing was known. One bad sheep will spoil a whole flock. I was a bad sheep. I hated slavery, slaveholders, and all pertaining to them; and I did not fail to inspire others with the same feeling wherever and whenever opportunity was presented.

"I have already implied that Mr. Edward Covey was a poor man. He was, in fact, just commencing to lay the foundation of his fortune, as fortune was regarded in a slave state. The first condition of wealth and respectability there being the ownership of human property, every nerve was strained by the poor man to obtain it, with little regard sometimes as to the means. In pursuit of this object, pious as Mr. Covey was, he proved himself as unscrupulous and base as the worst of his neighbors. In the beginning he was only able—as he said—“to buy one slave;” and scandalous and shocking as is the fact, he boasted that he bought her simply “as a breeder.” But the worst of this is not told in this naked statement. This young woman (Caroline was her name) was virtually compelled by Covey to abandon herself to the object for which be had purchased her; and the result was the birth of twins at the end of the year. At this addition to his human stock Covey and his wife were ecstatic with joy. No one dreamed of reproaching the woman or of finding fault with the hired man, Bill Smith, the father of the children, for Mr. Covey himself had locked the two up together every night, thus inviting the result.",The Life and Times of Frederick Douglas (The Autobiographies #3),Frederick Douglass,B00BIFLSUW,,yellow,,location,1652,2018-07-24 04:56:00+00:00

"It was generally supposed that slavery in the State of Maryland existed in its mildest form, and that it was totally divested of those harsh and terrible peculiarities which characterized the slave system in the Southern and South Western States of the American Union. The ground of this opinion was the contiguity of the free States, and the influence of their moral, religious, and humane sentiments. Public opinion was, indeed, a measurable restraint upon the cruelty and barbarity of masters, overseers, and slave-drivers, whenever and wherever it could reach them; but there were certain secluded and out of the way places, even in the State of Maryland, fifty years ago, seldom visited by a single ray of healthy public sentiment, where slavery, wrapt in its own congenial darkness, could and did develop all its malign and shocking characteristics, where it could be indecent without shame, cruel without shuddering, and murderous without apprehension or fear of exposure, or punishment.",The Life and Times of Frederick Douglas (The Autobiographies #3),Frederick Douglass,B00BIFLSUW,,yellow,,location,345,2018-07-24 04:56:00+00:00

I say for a time, because the fatal poison of irresponsible power, and the natural influence of slave customs, were not very long in making their impression on the gentle and loving disposition of my excellent mistress. She regarded me at first as a child, like any other.

"Although my old master, Captain Anthony, gave me, at the first of my coming to him from my grandmother’s, very little attention, and although that little was of a remarkably mild and gentle description, a few months only were sufficient to convince me that mildness and gentleness were not the prevailing or governing traits of his character. These excellent qualities were displayed only occasionally. He could, when it suited him, appear to be literally insensible to the claims of humanity. He could not only be deaf to the appeals of the helpless against the aggressor, but he could himself commit outrages deep, dark, and nameless. Yet he was not by nature worse than other men. Had he been brought up in a free state, surrounded by the full restraints of civilized society —restraints which are necessary to the freedom of all its members, alike and equally, Capt. Anthony might have been as humane a man as are members of such society generally. A man’s character always takes its hue, more or less, from the form and color of things about him.

"These mechanics were called “Uncles” by all the younger slaves, not because they really sustained that relationship to any, but according to plantation etiquette as a mark of respect, due from the younger to the older slaves. Strange and even ridiculous as it may seem, among a people so uncultivated and with so many stern trials to look in the face, there is not to be found among any people a more rigid enforcement of the law of respect to elders than is maintained among them.

"The remark in the olden time was not unfrequently made, that slaves were the most contented and happy laborers in the world, and their dancing and singing were referred to in proof of this alleged fact; but it was a great mistake to suppose them happy because they sometimes made those joyful noises. The songs of the slaves represented their sorrows, rather than their joys. Like tears, they were a relief to aching hearts. It is not inconsistent with the constitution of the human mind, that avails itself of one and the same method for expressing opposite emotions.

"While I heard of numerous murders committed by slaveholders on the eastern shore of Maryland, I never knew a solitary instance where a slaveholder was either hung or imprisoned for having murdered a slave. The usual pretext for such crimes was that the slave had offered resistance. Should a slave, when assaulted, but raise his hand in self-defense, the white assaulting party was fully justified by southern law, and southern public opinion in shooting the slave down, and for this there was no redress.",The Life and Times of Frederick Douglas (The Autobiographies #3),Frederick Douglass,B00BIFLSUW,,yellow,,location,834,2018-07-24 04:56:00+00:00
"But slavery soon proved its ability to divest her of these excellent qualities, and her home of its early happiness. Conscience cannot stand much violence. Once thoroughly injured, who is he who can repair the damage? If it be broken toward the slave on Sunday, it will be toward the master on Monday. It cannot long endure such shocks. It must stand unharmed, or it does not stand at all. As my condition in the family waxed bad, that of the family waxed no better. The first step in the wrong direction was the violence done to nature and to conscience, in arresting the benevolence that would have enlightened my young mind. In ceasing to instruct me, my mistress had to seek to justify herself to herself, and once consenting to take sides in such a debate, she was compelled to hold her position. One needs little knowledge of moral philosophy to see where she inevitably landed. She finally became even more violent in her opposition to my learning to read than was Mr. Auld himself. Nothing now appeared to make her more angry than seeing me, seated in some nook or corner, quietly reading a book or newspaper. She would rush at me with the utmost fury, and snatch the book or paper from my hand, with something of the wrath and consternation which a traitor might be supposed to feel on being discovered in a plot by some dangerous spy. The conviction once thoroughly established in her mind, that education and slavery were incompatible with each other, I was most narrowly watched in all my movements. If I remained in a separate room from the family for any considerable length of time, I was sure to be suspected of having a book, and was at once called to give an account of myself. But this was too late: the first and never-to-be-retraced step had been taken. Teaching me the alphabet had been the “inch” given, I was now waiting only for the opportunity to “take the ell.”",The Life and Times of Frederick Douglas (The Autobiographies #3),Frederick Douglass,B00BIFLSUW,,yellow,,location,1015,2018-07-24 04:56:00+00:00

"She was whipped, terribly whipped, but she was not subdued, and continued to denounce the overseer, and pour upon him every vile epithet she could think of. Such floggings are seldom repeated by overseers on the same persons. They prefer to whip those who were the most easily whipped. The doctrine that submission to violence is the best cure for violence did not hold good as between slaves and overseers. He was whipped oftener who was whipped easiest. That slave who had the courage to stand up for himself against the overseer, although he might have many hard stripes at first, became while legally a slave virtually a freeman. “You can shoot me,” said a slave to Rigby Hopkins, “but you can’t whip me,” and the result was he was neither whipped nor shot.",The Life and Times of Frederick Douglas (The Autobiographies #3),Frederick Douglass,B00BIFLSUW,,yellow,,location,585,2018-07-24 04:56:00+00:00
"The real feelings and opinions of the slaves were not much known or respected by their masters. The distance between the two was too great to admit of such knowledge; and in this respect Col. Lloyd was no exception to the rule. His slaves were so numerous he did not know them when he saw them. Nor, indeed, did all his slaves know him. It is reported of him, that riding along the road one day he met a colored man, and addressed him in what was the usual way of speaking to colored people on the public highways of the South: “Well, boy, who do you belong to?” “To Col. Lloyd,” replied the slave. “Well, does the Colonel treat you well?” “No, Sir,” was the ready reply. “What, does he work you hard?” “Yes, Sir.” “Well, don’t he give you enough to eat?” “Yes, sir, he gives me enough to eat, such as it is.” The Colonel rode on; the slave also went on about his business, not dreaming that be had been conversing with his master. He thought and said nothing of the matter, until two or three weeks afterwards, he was informed by his overseer that for having found fault with his master, he was now to be sold to a Georgia trader. He was immediately chained and handcuffed; and thus without a moment’s warning, he was snatched away, and forever sundered from his family and friends by a hand as unrelenting as that of death. This was the penalty of telling the simple truth, in answer to a series of plain questions. It was partly in consequence of such facts, that slaves, when inquired of as to their condition and the character of their masters, would almost invariably say that they were contented and their masters kind.",The Life and Times of Frederick Douglas (The Autobiographies #3),Frederick Douglass,B00BIFLSUW,,yellow,,location,755,2018-07-24 04:56:00+00:00
"I speak of overseers as a class, for they were such. They were as distinct from the slave-holding gentry of the south as are the fish-women of Paris, and the coal-heavers of London, distinct from other grades of society. They constituted a separate fraternity at the south. They were arranged and classified by that great law of attraction which determines the sphere and affinities of men; which ordains that men whose malign and brutal propensities preponderate over their moral and intellectual endowments shall naturally fall into those employments which promise the largest gratification to those predominating instincts or propensities.

"The reader may be surprised, that living in Baltimore as I had done for many years, when I tell the honest truth of the impressions I had in some way conceived of the social and material condition of the people at the north. I had no proper idea of the wealth, refinement, enterprise, and high civilization of this section of the country. My Columbian Orator, almost my only book, had done nothing to enlighten me concerning northern society. I had been taught that slavery was the bottom-fact of all wealth. With this foundation idea, I came naturally to the conclusion that poverty must be the general condition of the people of the free States. A white man holding no slaves in the country from which I came, was usually an ignorant and poverty-stricken man. Men of this class were contemptuously called “poor white trash.” Hence I supposed that since the non-slaveholders at the south were ignorant, poor, and degraded as a class, the non-slaveholders at the north must be in a similar condition. New Bedford therefore, which at that time was really the richest city in the Union, in proportion to its population, took me greatly by surprise, in the evidences it gave of its solid wealth and grandeur. I found that even the laboring classes lived in better houses, that their houses were more elegantly furnished, and were more abundantly supplied with conveniences and comforts, than the houses of many who owned slaves on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. This was true not only of the white people of that city, but it was so of my friend, Mr. Johnson. He lived in a nicer house, dined at a more ample board, was the owner of more books, the reader of more newspapers, was more conversant with the moral, social, and political condition of the country and the world than nine-tenths of the slaveholders in all Talbot county. I was not long in finding the cause of the difference in these respects, between the people of the north and south. It was the superiority of educated mind over mere brute force. I will not detain the reader by extended illustrations as to how my understanding was enlightened on this subject. On the wharves of New Bedford I received my first light. I saw there industry without bustle, labor without noise, toil—honest, earnest, and exhaustive, without the whip. There was no loud singing or hallooing, as at the wharves of southern ports when ships were loading or unloading; no loud cursing or quarreling; everything went on as smoothly as well-oiled machinery. One of the first incidents which impressed me with the superior mental character of labor in the north over that of the south, was in the manner of loading and unloading vessels. In a southern port twenty or thirty hands would be employed to do what five or six men, with the help of one ox, would do at the wharf in New Bedford. Main strength—human muscle—unassisted by intelligent skill, was slavery’s method of labor. With a capital of about sixty dollars in the shape of a good-natured old ox,…",The Life and Times of Frederick Douglas (The Autobiographies #3),Frederick Douglass,B00BIFLSUW,,yellow,,location,2929,2018-07-24 04:56:00+00:00

Also off the agenda is the election-day “coercion package” that may explain turnout in terms other than devotion to the army and its plans, including any legal requirement to vote, and explicit or implicit threats for not voting.

"A final filter is the ideology of anticommunism. Communism as the ultimate evil has always been the specter haunting property owners, as it threatens the very root of their class position and superior status. The Soviet, Chinese, and Cuban revolutions were traumas to Western elites, and the ongoing conflicts and the well-publicized abuses of Communist states have contributed to elevating opposition to communism to a first principle of Western ideology and politics. This ideology helps mobilize the populace against an enemy, and because the concept is fuzzy it can be used against anybody advocating policies that threaten property interests or support accommodation with Communist states and radicalism. It therefore helps fragment the left and labor movements and serves as a political-control mechanism. If the triumph of communism is the worst imaginable result, the support of fascism abroad is justified as a lesser evil.

"Before advertising became prominent, the price of a newspaper had to cover the costs of doing business. With the growth of advertising, papers that attracted ads could afford a copy price well below production costs. This put papers lacking in advertising at a serious disadvantage: their prices would tend to be higher, curtailing sales, and they would have less surplus to invest in improving the salability of the paper (features, attractive format, promotion, etc.). For this reason, an advertising-based system will tend to drive out of existence or into marginality the media companies and types that depend on revenue from sales alone. With advertising, the free market does not yield a neutral system in which final buyer choice decides.

It traces the routes by which money and power are able to filter out the news fit to print, marginalize dissent, and allow the government and dominant private interests to get their messages across to the public. The essential ingredients of our propaganda model, or set of news “filters,” fall under the following headings: (1) the size, concentrated ownership, owner wealth, and profit orientation of the dominant mass-media firms; (2) advertising as the primary income source of the mass media; (3) the reliance of the media on information provided by government, business, and “experts” funded and approved by these primary sources and agents of power; (4) “flak” as a means of disciplining the media; and (5) “anticommunism” as a national religion and control mechanism. These elements interact with and reinforce one another. The raw material of news must pass through successive filters, leaving only the cleansed residue fit to print.

"One important reason for this was the rise in scale of newspaper enterprise and the associated increase in capital costs from the mid-nineteenth century onward, which was based on technological improvements along with the owners’ increased stress on reaching large audiences. The expansion of the free market was accompanied by an “industrialization of the press.” The total cost of establishing a national weekly on a profitable basis in 1837 was under a thousand pounds, with a break-even circulation of 6,200 copies. By 1867, the estimated start-up cost of a new London daily was 50,000 pounds.

This droll pattern of identical apologetics for each successor terrorist, and ex post denigration of the one ousted, is an Orwellian process that the Western press associates with totalitarian states, but it happens here.

"Any possible U.S. connection to the crime was, of course, “far out,” and could not be raised in the U.S. media. That we don’t do this sort of thing is an ideological premise of the patriotic press, no matter what the facts of recent history tell us.39 But still, the question might have been raised whether the environment that the United States was helping to create in El Salvador, training and aiding a murderous army whose violence had driven Romero to passionate opposition, made the United States indirectly guilty of the murder? The press never discussed this point either. The Times quotes Secretary of State Cyrus Vance on the murder: “Two weeks ago I wrote the Archbishop and said: ‘We share a repugnance for the violence provoked by both extremes that is taking the lives of innocent people. We deplore the efforts of those seeking to silence the voices of reason and moderation with explosives, intimidation and murder.’ ”40 The paper points out that the letter from Vance was in reply to Romero’s appeal to cease supplying arms. The article failed to include the gist of Romero’s argument, and it did not quote that part of Vance’s letter that rejected the archbishop’s appeal. The report also did not take note of Vance’s serious misrepresentation of the archbishop’s position when he says that “We share a repugnance [for] … both extremes”; Romero attributed the killings to the army and the right, not “both extremes.” We may note also that while Romero was victimized by the very forces that Vance supported, and Romero’s forecasts seem to be vindicated by his own murder, there is no hint in the account of any irony or criticism of Vance and his associates.

It freely applied words like “thuggery,” “shameless,” and “crude” to the Polish state. The fact that police officers were quickly identified, tried, and convicted it attributed to the agitation at home and abroad that put a limit on villainy. This is a good point, and one that we stress throughout this book: villainy may be constrained by intense publicity.

"Another structural relationship of importance is the media companies’ dependence on and ties with government. The radio-TV companies and networks all require government licenses and franchises and are thus potentially subject to government control or harassment. This technical legal dependency has been used as a club to discipline the media, and media policies that stray too often from an establishment orientation could activate this threat.36 The media protect themselves from this contingency by lobbying and other political expenditures, the cultivation of political relationships, and care in policy. The political ties of the media have been impressive. Table 1-3 shows that fifteen of ninety-five outside directors of ten of the media giants are former government officials, and Peter Dreier gives a similar proportion in his study of large newspapers.37 In television, the revolving-door flow of personnel between regulators and the regulated firms was massive during the years when the oligopolistic structure of the media and networks was being established.38",Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media,"Edward S.

"Anthropologist Sarah Hrdy, a feminist and self-described sociobiologist, wrote one of the earliest evolutionarily informed analyses of the idea of patriarchy in her 1981 book The Woman That Never Evolved. Much as I do here, Hrdy traced the initial foundation of male dominance to the fact of anisogamy, but also noted the important role of socioecology in expanding or diminishing its extent. Hrdy criticized existing explanations for male dominance that focus exclusively socialization, arguing that:

They cannot explain sexual asymmetry in even one other species. Yet male dominance characterizes the majority of several hundred other species that, like our own, belong to the order Primates. Save for a handful of highly informative exceptions, sexual asymmetries are nearly universal among primates. Logic alone should warn us against explaining such a widespread phenomenon with reference only to a specialized subset of human examples.

The “highly informative exceptions” Hrdy mentions are in reference to three social contexts among some primate species that are most favorable to high female status: where there is a monogamous mating system, where females have a short breeding season, which relaxes male competition for most of the year, and/or where females live in matrilineal (rank inherited through the female line) “sisterhood” groups of relatives. Hrdy emphasizes the role of monogamy in particular, writing that, “Only under one particular type of breeding system, monogamy, do we routinely find anything approaching equality between the sexes in either size or rights of access to preferred resources.”",On the Nature of Patriarchy - Quillette,quillette.com,,,,,order,4,2018-12-21 13:41:15+00:00
"But as we see here, even among relatively egalitarian, non-patrilineal societies, we can find strongly male-dominated institutions. Numerous relatively egalitarian hunter-gatherer societies were known to have engaged in wife-capture practices against neighboring groups throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

With these points in mind, we might consider an alternative explanation for male-dominance across human societies. Evolutionary psychologist David Buss, for example, attributes patriarchal social systems largely (but not entirely) to female choice:

My view is that women’s preferences for a successful, ambitious, and resource-capable mate coevolved with men’s competitive mating strategies, which include risk taking, status striving, derogation of competitors, coalition formation, and an array of individual efforts aimed at surpassing other men on the dimensions that women desire. The intertwining of these coevolved mechanisms in men and women created the conditions for men to dominate in the domain of resources.

One issue with this explanation remains the ubiquity of male-biased marriage arrangements across cultures. Young girls who are married off usually have very little say in the matter; overwhelmingly marriage arrangements tend to benefit males from powerful or high-status kin groups. Still, the fitness interests of a young girl and her kin do align in some respects, and young girls may exercise some choice in vigorously protesting a marriage, or divorcing when she can, but this is a quite limited degree of choice.",On the Nature of Patriarchy - Quillette,quillette.com,,,,,order,2,2018-12-21 13:17:42+00:00

The relatively limited power of female coalitions across human societies, due in part to patrilocal residency (living close to the husband’s family after marriage) being more common than matrilocal residency.
The strength of male-male alliances across cultures, due in part to the demands of warfare.
Male control of resources.
Large variance in male wealth and power, leaving women more vulnerable to the authority of powerful men and reducing women’s control over their sexuality.
Female behaviors that promote male resource control and control over female sexuality.

"By the time things begin to look dicey, we tend to be so invested, emotionally and often physically, that we do most of the persuasion ourselves.

"Words That Work Matt pays incredible attention to word choice and ordering (diction and syntax). He loves studying “code poets”—coders who have elegant, poetic style—but he does the same with spoken language. He recommended I read the book Words That Work, written by Republican political strategist Frank Luntz. It’s brilliant. Matt added, “If someone likes that book, then I might point them to George Lakoff. He has a great seminal work from the 1980s called Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things.” He loves books about framing and language.","Tools of Titans: The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers",Timothy Ferriss,B01HSMRWNU,,,,location,3741,2019-06-11 11:02:24.442191+00:00
"As Tony recounted, Buffett told him, “Investing in yourself is the most important investment you’ll ever make in your life. . . . There’s no financial investment that’ll ever match it, because if you develop more skill, more ability, more insight, more capacity, that’s what’s going to really provide economic freedom. . . . It’s those skill sets that really make that happen.” This echoes what Jim Rohn famously said, “If you let your learning lead to knowledge, you become a fool. If you let your learning lead to action, you become wealthy.”","Tools of Titans: The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers",Timothy Ferriss,B01HSMRWNU,,,,location,3820,2018-08-21 04:56:00+00:00
". Stephen Hawking actually has the best quote on this and also [a] legitimate story. . . . [He] has the right to complain probably more than anybody. He says that, ‘When you complain, nobody wants to help you,’ and it’s the simplest thing and so plainly spoken. Only he could really say that brutal, honest truth, but it’s true, right? If you spend your time focusing on the things that are wrong, and that’s what you express and project to people you know, you don’t become a source of growth for people, you become a source of destruction for people. That draws more destructiveness.","Tools of Titans: The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers",Timothy Ferriss,B01HSMRWNU,,,,location,5503,2018-08-21 04:56:00+00:00

"Sympatric speciation is either a rare exception or an illusion, depending on which argumentative biologist you consult.

"For dwarfism, different causes might apply. While rodents become automatically less prolific when they are crowded, Foster wrote, artiodactyls generally don’t. The result is that deer, hippos, and other even-toed ungulates “are especially susceptible of reaching the limit of their food supply resulting in malnutrition and stunting of the young.” In the absence of intrinsic population control, overpopulation among such a species could result in stunting. Starvation-caused stunting isn’t the same as dwarfism, but over many generations it might lead to dwarfism,",The Song of the Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinctions,David Quammen,B004G8QS7G,,,,location,2862,2019-09-23 09:50:25.857319+00:00
"The ecosystem itself is not just a landscape full of plant and animal species; it’s an intricate network of relationships, including those between predators and their prey, between flowering plants and their pollinators, between fruiting plants and the animals that disperse their seeds. Each such relationship constitutes a link between trophic levels. Trophic cascades, as defined by Diamond in his “Rosetta Stone” paper, are the secondary effects that can ramify from level to level in consequence of a single extinction.",The Song of the Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinctions,David Quammen,B004G8QS7G,,,,location,5733,2019-05-06 09:11:05.810020+00:00

"But, by the mid-1870s, when the North withdrew its oversight in the face of southern hostility, whites in the South began to resurrect the caste system founded under slavery. Nursing the wounds of defeat and seeking a scapegoat, much like Germany in the years leading up to Nazism, they began to undo the opportunities accorded freed slaves during Reconstruction and to refine the language of white supremacy.",The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration,Isabel Wilkerson,B003EY7JGM,,,,location,695,2020-02-25 12:07:08.517118+00:00
"They were already citizens. But where they came from, they were not treated as such. Their every step was controlled by the meticulous laws of Jim Crow, a nineteenth-century minstrel figure that would become shorthand for the violently enforced codes of the southern caste system. The Jim Crow regime persisted from the 1880s to the 1960s, some eighty years, the average life span of a fairly healthy man.

"In those unhappy days of the Republic, when all presumptions were in favor of slavery, and a colored man as a slave met less resistance in the use of public conveyances than a colored man as a freeman, I happened to be in Philadelphia, and was afforded an opportunity to witness this preference. I took a seat in a street car by the side of my friend Mrs. Amy Post, of Rochester, New York, who, like myself, had come to Philadelphia to attend an anti-slavery meeting. I had no sooner seated myself when the conductor hastened to remove me from the car. My friend remonstrated, and the amazed conductor said, “Lady, does he belong to you?” “He does,” said Mrs. Post, and there the matter ended. I was allowed to ride in peace, not because I was a man, and had paid my fare, but because I belonged to somebody.

"The practice of separating mothers from their children and hiring them out at distances too great to admit of their meeting, save at long intervals, was a marked feature of the cruelty and barbarity of the slave system; but it was in harmony with the grand aim of that system, which always and everywhere sought to reduce man to a level with the brute.
